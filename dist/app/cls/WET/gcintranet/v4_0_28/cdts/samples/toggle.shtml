            <h3>Chapter 1. Introduction</h3>
            </summary>
            <p>The Department's mission is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that help them live productive and rewarding lives, and to improve Canadians' quality of life.  Our work touches Canadians at every stage, from learning to employment to parenting to retirement.  Through partnerships with businesses, community organizations, cities, provinces and territories, the Department collaborates with others to deliver targeted support for Canadian children, youth, workers, seniors, the homeless, Aboriginal people and persons with disabilities.</p>
            <p>The Department relies, in part, on Grants and Contributions (<abbr>Gs&amp;Cs</abbr>) to succeed in its mission to enhance the well-being of Canadians, and to promote national economic growth and productivity. </p>
            <p>The Operations Guide is a practical, online reference tool meant to guide program delivery staff in delivering effective <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> programming.  It is a generic resource that broadly applies to all project-based <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> initiatives (rather than individual, one-on-one agreements) and, as such, provides:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>an overview of the work context;</li>
            <li>a detailed explanation of the project life cycle;</li>
            <li>clear descriptions of program delivery staff roles and responsibilities;</li>
            <li>step-by-step procedural instructions; and,</li>
            <li>links to reference materials such as current legislation,</li>
            <li>regulations, terms and conditions, policies, directives,</li>
            <li>branch-specific resources (where available online) and other supporting materials.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Operations Guide is not a stand-alone document  and must be applied in conjunction with various Directives, Guidelines, Policies and Legislation, in addition to the Common System for Grants and Contributions (<abbr>CSGC</abbr>) which guides administration  and management of all <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> programming.</p>
            <p>Additionally, a Policy for Portfolio-Wide Training for Grants and Contributions Practitioners has been implemented within the Department. Information and other useful tools in support of the policy can be found on the <a href="/en/service-canada/pob/coegc/training/index.shtml">Centre of Expertise Training Page</a>.</p>
            <h4>1.1 Project Life Cycle and Structure of the Guide</h4>
            <p>The project life cycle approach is a way of organizing the major steps involved in moving from one phase of <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> program administration to the next. It simultaneously provides the overarching context for program delivery while guiding program delivery staff through each of the phases involved in the process to support achievable outcomes while remaining transparent and accountable for the use of public funds.</p>
            <p>Despite its distinct phases, the project life cycle is not a linear process. Each phase is related to every other phase in the cycle, and not simply to the phase immediately before or after. For example, clear and consistent assessment practices make the recommendation, review and approval phase transparent to organizations. Meaningful agreements with clear objectives and anticipated results lead to efficient payment and activity reporting, and monitoring practices.</p>
            <p>Throughout the project life cycle, program delivery staff often revisit and revise tasks within the phases based on the changing needs of the community or of the Department, or as a result of lessons learned from monitoring and evaluation activities.</p>
            <p>Each phase of the project life cycle becomes an opportunity for program delivery staff—working together as a team—to manage <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> effectively and improve results for Canadians.</p>

            <p><strong>Structure of the Guide</strong></p>
            <p>Following some introductory material about Roles  and Responsibilities and Transfer Payments, the Guide is structure.  to follow the project life cycle common to  all <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> programs&mdash;whether delivered nationally, regionally or  locally&mdash;across the Department while also recognizing that individual regions,  branches and programs often customize these administrative practices to suit  the unique needs of their targeted clientele.  In essence, this Guide  describes the stages program delivery staff must follow when soliciting,  assessing, recommending, approving, preparing, implementing, monitoring and  closing agreements. </p>

            <h4>1.2 The Common System for Grants and Contributions</h4>
            <p>The Common System for Grants and Contributions  (<abbr>CSGC</abbr>) and its associate. <em><abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> User Guide</em> is a web-based application available on the Department's Intranet system.  When used in tandem with  this Guide, these online tools help program delivery staff administer, deliver  and monitor <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> programming.</p>
            <p>The system was originally designed to meet the  needs of the Department's business lines, following the project life cycle and  the client cycle, and continues to be modified to reflect new business  processes as the Department improves the efficiency and effectiveness of <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> programs.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> has two modules:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>the Project Life Cycle (<abbr>PLC</abbr>) is used to administer grants and contributions; and,</li>
            <li>the Client Module is used to  pay benefits to individuals through grants, contributions and other services  delivered by the Department.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The content of this Guide largely corresponds with  the use of the first <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> module, following the project life cycle approach to  move from one phase of project administration to the next.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> is also linked to the Department's  financial management system (SAP) for the administration of payments, program  budgets, expenditures and commitments.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> supports program delivery staff's work by:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>reducing  the need for paper documentation (e.g. printed notes to file);</li>
            <li>organizing  information in searchable files that can easily be retrieved;</li>
            <li>ensuring  compliance with:
            <ul>
            <li>program terms and conditions</li>
            <li>TBS Policy on Transfer Payments</li>
            <li>operational policies</li>
            <li>program guidelines;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>standardizing  forms;</li>
            <li>strengthening  financial management;</li>
            <li>facilitating  the generation of reports;</li>
            <li>making  it easier to track and demonstrate program and project results; and,</li>
            <li>providing  an audit trail and tracking capacity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While carrying out <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> activities, one should  simultaneously consult both this Guide and the <a href="/eng/coegc/csgc/index.shtml"><em><abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> User Guide</em>,</a> as they are complementary&mdash;yet distinct&mdash;guidance  components of the project life cycle. </p>

            <h3>Chapter 2. The Role of Program Delivery Staff in Administrating Grants and Contributions (<abbr>Gs&amp;Cs</abbr>)</h3>
            </summary>
            <p>Before beginning to work through the operational  requirements of delivering <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> programs, it is important to understand:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the overall  context of departmental program  delivery planning and how it affects the work of program delivery staff;</li>
            <li>the roles  and responsibilities throughout the project life cycle of program delivery staff; </li>
            <li>the segregation of duties and how it further defines  these roles and responsibilities; and,</li>
            <li>the  appropriate manner to communicate with Applicants and Recipients. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.1 Roles and Responsibilities during the Project Life Cycle</h4>
            <p>Whether programs are delivered nationally,  regionally or locally, program delivery staff are responsible for the effective  administration of <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> throughout the project life cycle.  These  responsibilities may include, but are not necessarily limited to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>contributing  to national/regional/local strategies for the use of grants and contributions  funds;</li>
            <li>promoting  programs in the community;</li>
            <li>developing,  assessing, negotiating, and recommending projects for approval;</li>
            <li>administering  agreements with individuals, communities and organizations;</li>
            <li>ensuring  that transfer payments are made in a manner that complies with the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-1.html">Financial Administration Act</a> , the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525">Treasury Board Policy o.  Transfer Payments</a> and the <a href="http://iservice.prv/eng/finance/policies/commitment_control_acct_veri_payment_requisitioning.shtml">Policy  on Commitment Control</a>, <a href="http://iservice.prv/eng/finance/policies/commitment_control_acct_veri_payment_requisitioning.shtml">Account  Verification and Payment</a>; </li>
            <li>monitoring  and evaluating project activities &ndash; especially using .  risk-based approach  which takes into consideration knowledge of the organization; </li>
            <li>providing  guidance to funding organizations to ensure effective implementation of  agreements;</li>
            <li>liaising  with other departments, when necessary, for project development or to avoid  duplication;</li>
            <li>engagin. stakeholders,  both internal and external to the Department, on program priorities and  specific projects;</li>
            <li>facilitating  and participating in the development of partnerships with a broad range of  government and non-government organizations in order to achieve common  objectives;</li>
            <li>providing  National Headquarters (<abbr>NHQ</abbr>) and Regional Headquarters (<abbr>RHQ</abbr>) with status reports  and project summary information, as required;</li>
            <li>recommending  community representatives for <abbr title="National Headquarters">NHQ</abbr>/<abbr title="Regional Headquarters">RHQ</abbr> stakeholder engagement committees;</li>
            <li>sharing  lessons learned and success stories; and,</li>
            <li>ensuring  Government of Canada visibility through projects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although the information found within this Guide  mainly pertains to the tasks of program delivery staff , there exist, of  course, a number of other positions which directly support the program delivery  staff and the delivery of <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> programming, including Managers, Senior  Development Officers, Business Expert Managers, Business Expert Consultants,  etc&hellip;</p>
            <h4>2.2 Communication Protocol with Applicant and Recipient</h4>
            <p>The following  communication protocol supports the existing escalation process for <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> programs and provides consistent messaging when responding to enquiries from  applicants or recipients about the status of their application or request for  amendment in cases where the projects are pending approval. The Communication  Protocol with Applicants and Recipients also includes steps to be followed to  escalate complex cases.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Message</strong></p>
            <p>The following  standardized key message is to be used when program delivery staff communicates  with applicants concerning projects pending approval:</p>
            <p><strong><em>"Your application is currently being processed.  Following the assessment of applications,  applicants will be notified in writing whether their project has been  approved."</em></strong></p>
            <p>The following standardized  key message is to be used when program delivery staff communicates with  recipients concerning amendments pending approval:</p>
            <p><strong><em>"Your request for an  amendment is currently being processed.   Following the review and assessment phase, the Department will contact  you once a decision is made."</em></strong></p>
            <p>In addition to this  messages, program delivery staff may remind applicants and/or recipients that  any expenses incurred prior to the start date, or approval date in case of a  major amendment, are at the applicant's and/or recipient's own risk and costs  and will not be reimbursed by the Department.</p>
            <p><strong>Documentation &ndash; Note to File</strong></p>
            <p>All requests from  applicants or recipients concerning the status of their application or  amendment request are to be noted in the Common System for Grants and  Contributions (<abbr>CSGC</abbr>). A "Note to File" must include: the name of the applicant  or recipient representative, contact information (address, telephone and  email); the date and time of the interaction with the Department; and the  nature of the interaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Referring Calls to  Managers</strong></p>
            <p>If, over the course of  any interaction with an applicant or recipient, program delivery staff  determines that concerns are increasing, they are instructed to courteously  advise the applicant or recipient that the matter is being referred to a  manager. Staff will then inform the manager of the matter as per normal  escalation processes in order to address and/or resolve the applicant's or  recipient's concerns.</p>
            <p><strong>Escalation</strong></p>
            <p>In cases where an  applicant or recipient contacts program delivery staff and staff determines  that the applicant or recipient's concerns regarding their application or  amendment pending approval are escalating, program delivery staff should refer  the matter to their program manager via email. The program manager must assess  the applicant's or recipient's concerns based on information provided by staff.  If the applicant or recipient continues to express concerns or dissatisfaction  with actions taken, and the manager ascertains that the applicant or recipient  will escalate their concerns higher (i.e. contact the program director or other  program officials, a Member of Parliament or the Minister etc.), the program  manager must notify the program director immediately via email. The program  director will advise the appropriate NHQ program director and follow the normal  escalation process.</p>
            <p>To support appropriate  accountability and ensure optimal issue management, regional and NHQ program  delivery and management staff involved in the escalation of problematic files  must brief their superiors on emerging issues and ensure that the systematic  documentation of facts and relevant information is done as a "Note to File"  both in the paper file and in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</p>
            <h4>2.3 Segregation of Duties</h4>
            <p>The <em>segregation of duties</em> is an internal process  that strengthens the Department's program delivery within the community.   In practical terms, it ensures that no one program delivery staff member  independently executes all activities of the project life cycle for an assigned  file, this would entail an appropriate division of roles and responsibilities  between those who review and approve applications, and those who approve  payments, monitor project progress and deal with performance issues during the  life of an agreement. Segregation happens between  the program delivery staff who assesses the application for funding and the  program delivery staff who manages the agreement. The segregation of duties can occur after the Recommendation and  Approval phase or once the agreement is signed. PDS should check with their  manager or their program-specific guidelines to confirm where segregation  occurs for their program.</p>
            <p>This practice:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>guarantees  no single employee has simultaneous access to financial functions that should  be segregated, such as the input and approval of a payment;</li>
            <li>helps  program delivery staff avoid conflicts of interest;</li>
            <li>strengthens  departmental accountability and transparency for <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> funding;</li>
            <li>standardizes  the steps involved in <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> administration; and,</li>
            <li>improves  program efficiencies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The segregation of duties is one component of the Department's  delivery of Grants and Contributions designed to improve program and project  outcomes while ensuring national consistency and accountability. <br />
            Managers are accountable for coordinating the  assignment of files and for ensuring that the segregation of duties is being  properly defined for all program delivery staff. </p>
            <p>Segregation of duties is managed differently across the spectrum of  departmental programs. Please ask your team leader/manager how the segregation  of duties is applied within your program.</p>
            <p><strong>Segregation of Duties Model </strong></p>
            <p>Although interpreted in various ways across the Department,  a common form divides the project life cycle into two discrete phases, as per  the example outlined here:</p>

            <p>. Shared responsibility: The segregation of duties can occur after the Recommendation and  Approval phase or once the agreement is signed. Program delivery staff should check with  their team leader/manager or their program-specific guidelines to confirm where  segregation occurs for their program.</p>
            <p>** RAMM can be shared between  the Front and Back Offices depending on the program area.</p>
            <p>Under this segregation of duties model, program  delivery staff are responsible for either the Application Management (referred  to as Front office) or the Agreement Management and Close-Out (referred to as Back  office).</p>
            <p>Functions can be rotated among program delivery staff  on a file-by-file basis -- for example, one could complete the Application Management  phase for project A, but undertake the Agreement Management phase for project  B.  Alternatively, program delivery staff could specialize in one function  or the other -- for example, one may concentrate on the Application Management  function while another focuses on the Agreement Management.</p>
            <p>While certain programs are not subject to the  departmental Segregation of Duties Directive; they do, however, follow the  spirit of the directive. Regions will determine how they will implement the  principles of segregation of duties according to their resource levels and  regional structure. File assignments should be done as applications are  received and should ideally not change throughout the screening and assessment  processes.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 3. Transfer Payments</h3>
            </summary>
            <p>Transfer payments are transfers of money, goods, services or assets made  from an appropriation to individuals, organizations or other levels of  government, without the federal government directly receiving goods or services  in return.</p>
            <p>The Department facilitates community capacity building by contributing  programs, services, expertise and information that improve skills, expand  learning opportunities, create jobs, develop support services, disseminate  information, and engage citizens in the social and economic development of  their communities through transfer payments. Projects funded by the Department  will ultimately support the vision, mission and mandate of the Department.</p>
            <p>There are three types of  transfer payments:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>grants;</li>
            <li>contributions; and,</li>
            <li>other transfer payments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To  read about the general conditions which must be met for all projects funded by  specific programs, refe. to the Treasury Boar. <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Policy on  Transfer Payments</em></a> and its associated <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#cha1"><em>Directive</em></a><em>.</em></p>
            <h4>3.1 Grants</h4>
            <p>Grants are unconditional transfer payments that the Government provides to individuals or organizations for activities that meet eligibility criteria set by the funding program. It is a transfer payment which is not subject to being accounted for or audited, but for which eligibility and entitlement may be verified. The applicant may be required to report on results achieved.</p>
            <p>Grant funds can be either statutory or non-statutory.</p>
            <p>A statutory grant is set out in statute by parliament with a specific funding amount, recipient (or class of recipients), and purpose.  Terms and Conditions are not always required for a statutory grant, nor are projects generally assessed.  A recipient is able to receive the grant simply by meeting eligibility criteria described in the statute. </p>
            <p>A non-statutory grant is created and governed by a set of Terms and Conditions approved by the Treasury Board.  They are similar to contribution programs and are generally project based.  A recipient must apply and be approved for funding by the Minister (or delegate) prior to payment rather than simply being eligible.</p>
            <p>For a first-hand look at the basic requirements relating to the administration of grants, refer to the Treasury Boar. <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em></a> and its associated <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#cha1"><em>Directive</em></a>, including <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#appD"><em>Appendix D: Terms and Conditions for Grants</em></a> and <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#appF"><em>Appendix F: Funding Agreement Provision for Grants</em></a>.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Contributions</h4>
            <p><strong>A. Contributions</strong></p>
            <p>A  contribution is a <strong>conditional transfer payment</strong> to an individual or  organization for a specified purpose, the conditions of which must be defined  in a contribution agreement. The contribution is subject to being accounted for  and audited.</p>
            <p>All contribution funding agreements share the following features:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>a  conditional agreement is signed by both parties (i.e. the Department and the  organization);</li>
            <li>the  organization must account for expenditure categories and funding amounts; and,</li>
            <li>the  Department has the right to audit an organization's use of contribution funds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For a  first-hand look at the basic requirements relating to the administration of  contributions, refer to the Treasury Boar. <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Policy on  Transfer Payments</em></a> and its associated <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#cha1"><em>Directive</em></a>,  including <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#appE"><em>Appendix E:  Terms and Conditions for Contributions</em></a> and <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#appG"><em>Appendix G:  Funding Agreement Provision for Contributions</em></a>.</p>
            <p><strong>B. Contributions to Aboriginal Recipients</strong></p>
            <p>Contributions to Aboriginal recipients are  very similar to contributions to all other organizations or individuals. They  must be for a purpose specified in a formal funding agreement and the Aboriginal  recipient must account for the use of the contribution funds. For some  programs, the Department uses Flexible contributions for Aboriginal recipients.</p>
            <p>Flexible contributions are used frequently in programs targeting Aboriginal  organizations. They are used when there is a two or more year agreement and the  recipient requires the flexibility to move expenditures and funds between  fiscal years. Funds unexpended at the end of a fiscal year may be transferred  to the next fiscal year. Any unexpended funds at the expiry of an agreement  must still be returned to the Department. Flexible contributions must be  specifically listed as an option in program Terms and Conditions and must be  based on recipient need. Flexible contributions can only be made to aboriginal  recipients.</p>
            <p>For a first-hand look at the basic requirements relating to the  administration of contributions to Aboriginal recipients, refer to the Treasury  Boar. <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em></a> and its associated <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#cha1"><em>Directive</em></a>, including <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#appK"><em>Appendix K: Transfer Payments to Aboriginal Recipients</em></a><em>.</em></p>
            <p><strong>C. Contributions to  Provinces and Territories</strong></p>
            <p>In many programs provincial  and territorial governments are eligible recipients, but the program is not  intended for devolution to the provinces and territories for their own delivery  (like in the Labour Market Agreements or Employment Benefits and Support  Measures.) In these contributions a provinces and territories should be treated  the same way as any other applicant to the program, regardless of additional  flexibilities in the directive on transfer payments.</p>
            <h4>3.3 Other Transfer Payments</h4>
            <p>Other transfer payments are transfers to other levels of government or transfers  to foreign recipients. Both are generally funding agreements, although grants  may be used where appropriate or set out in statute (as in a statutory grant).</p>
            <p>Examples of other transfer payments would be the <em>Labour Market Agreements (LMA), Labour Market Development  Agreements(LMDAs)</em> and <a href="http://labour.prv/eng/labour/organization/index.shtml"><em>Labour Program</em></a> who has agreements with foreign recipients. </p>
            <p>For a  first-hand look at the basic requirements relating to the administration of  other transfer payments, refer to the Treasury Board <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Policy on  Transfer Payments</em></a> and its associated <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#cha1"><em>Directive</em></a>,  including <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208&amp;section=text#appJ">Appendix J. <em>Transfer . Payments to Foreign Recipients</em></a>.</p>
            <h4>3.4  Sources of Funding</h4>
            <p>Consolidated Revenue Funds (<abbr>CRF</abbr>) is  the Government of Canada's bank account which combines all public monies  received by the federal government, such as GST, income tax. It is from this  fund that departments receive their funding. In our department, CRF pays for Operations and Maintenance  (O&amp;M) costs, service contracts, and supplies as well as for some grant and  contribution programs.</p>
            <p>The Employment  Insurance (EI) account is a designated account and is used for income  benefits and payments to individuals (through EI Part I), provide employment  benefits and aid to gaining employment (through EI Part II), and supports a  number of employment programs;</p>
            <p>Money from the EI account  cannot be used to fund anything that is not legislated under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-5.6/page-1.html"><em>Employment  Insurance Act</em></a> and approved through the annual EI Expenditure Plan  submitted to the Treasury Board on an annual basis.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 5. Applications</h3>
            </summary>
            <p>The application  process must be fair and transparent, thus helping to ensure that all  applicants have equal access to program funds.</p>
            <p>There are five key steps to this stage of the project life cycle:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>application intake;</li>
            <li>developing applications;</li>
            <li>ensuring complete applications;</li>
            <li>receiving and acknowledging applications; and</li>
            <li>opening the project file. </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Application Intake</h4>
            <p>The method chosen by a program  to accept applications will depend upon a number of factors such as the funding  stream, community priorities and needs, availability of service providers,  geography, requirements of the program&rsquo;s terms and conditions, the amount of  funding available and stakeholder expectations.</p>
            <p>Information on funding  opportunities can be found on the <a href="http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/funding/index.shtml">Funding Programs website </a> which provides a central  point of access to all grants and contributions programs offered by the  Department.</p>
            <p>Programs can receive  applications in many ways, including:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Continuous Intake </li>
            <li>Call for Concept (Expression of  Interest/Letter of Intent)</li>
            <li>Call for Proposals</li>
            <li>Solicited Applications</li>
            <li>Unsolicited Applications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whatever the process chosen, it must be based on the principles of fairness, openness and transparency. Applicants should also be reminded that they are not entitled to departmental  funding until a legal agreement has been signed by both parties. No costs  can be incurred and no activities can take place before the start date of a signed  agreement. No matter the process  selected, any applications granted an extension beyond the identified deadline  must be noted on file and justification for accepting late submissions be  documented.</p>
            <h5>Continuous Intake</h5>
            <p>Continuous intake entails a process where a program&rsquo;s funding criteria are made available to the public on a long term basis with no specific  deadline for the submission of applications. Applicants can therefore submit an  application for funding at any time, which the program then processes on a  first come, first serve basis.</p>
            <h5>Call for Concept (Expression of Interest / Letter of Intent)</h5>
            <p>Most often, this method is a formal process where organizations are invited by the Department to submit a proposal based on  program initiatives. The call for concept can also be used as a screening  mechanism or to develop a list of potential applicants. Once the Call for  Concepts have been reviewed, applicants may be requested to submit a complete  application.</p>
            <h5>Call for Proposals</h5>
            <p>A Call for Proposals (<abbr>CFP</abbr>) is an open, formal and planned process used to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>identify  interested, qualified applicants;</li>
            <li>inform  potential applicants of a new program delivery requirement via a proactive, targeted marketing approach; and</li>
            <li>request  the submission of a formal application for funding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A <abbr title="Call for Proposals">CFP</abbr> is based on the  Department&rsquo;s national, regional or local program business plan.</p>
            <p>The application package for a <abbr title="Call for Proposals">CFP</abbr> typically includes the following key information:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>an outline of the program objectives and priorities;</li>
            <li>an invitation to submit proposals;</li>
            <li>the eligibility criteria;</li>
            <li>the required elements of a proposal;</li>
            <li>the deadline for submission;</li>
            <li>a description of the review and selection process; and</li>
            <li>a description of service standards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once approved, a <abbr title="Call for Proposals">CFP</abbr> is posted  on the Department&rsquo;s Internet site on the Funding Programs landing page; other  dissemination options could include regular mail, email, and advertising in  national and local newspapers.</p>
            <p>For additional details on the <abbr title="Call for Proposals">CFP</abbr> process - including information on exceptions for entering into a <abbr title="Call for Proposals">CFP</abbr> process, please consul. th. <em>Call for Proposal</em> page on the Centre of  Expertise website.</p>
            <h5>Solicited Applications</h5>
            <p>A program occasionally solicits applications from individual organizations; this may occur, for instance, when  an unanticipated situation arises requiring a rapid response or following a  call for concept process. There are several ways in which applications can be targeted.  One could, for example, create a list of individuals and organizations with a  proven track record in delivering effective programs and services, then use  this list to contact potential applicants&mdash;in person, by phone, mail, email or fax&mdash;and invite them to submit an application. Potential contacts can be  identified by:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>reviewing other office lists;</li>
            <li>searching the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> for past and current funding organizations;</li>
            <li>brainstorming  with colleagues who know the sector or community and its clients well;</li>
            <li>engaging umbrella organizations including asking for their membership lists; and</li>
            <li>consulting  with other departments and agencies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Unsolicited Applications</h5>
            <p>The Department may receive  unsolicited applications at any time.</p>
            <p>Applicants often approach a  variety of funders in the hope of securing financing for their  initiatives. They may also submit an application to the Department rather  than a specific program when they believe they have a good idea but they don&rsquo;t  know where it fits. Generally, the applicant has not been approached by the  Department but has heard of the program through word of mouth or their own  research.</p>
            <p>Depending upon the program, if  an application appears to meet a program&rsquo;s criteria and procedures, the  applicant could either be informed of any CFPs, or engaged and provided with  feedback as required.</p>
            <p>If, however, an application has merit but falls outside the scope of the  solicited program, the applicant should be referred to appropriate programs  within the Department or to other  departments.</p>
            <h4>5.2 Tools</h4>
            <h5>Receiving Applications via Grants and Contributions Online Services  (<abbr>GCOS</abbr>)</h5>
            <p>Within your program area external organizations  may be able to apply for funding using <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>. The <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr> provides applicants and  recipients with a safe, secure and user-friendly environment to apply for  funding online.</p>
            <p>Once  an Application for Funding has been successfully submitted by an applicant via  the <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>, it is automatically routed to the appropriate Cost Centre (<abbr>CC</abbr>) within the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> staging area based on the program  selected and postal code (where applicable).</p>
            <p>For  more information on the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Staging Area please refer to the Online Services Toolkit on the COE Website.</p>
            <h5>The Applicant Guide</h5>
            <p>The Applicant Guide will  assist applicants in filling out the standard <a href="http://forms-formulaires.prv/eform99/forms/FF99/ESDC-EMP5523(2013-04-003)E.pdf">Application for Funding</a> form by providing  organizations program specific clarification on the level of detail required to  complete the application.</p>
            <p>Program areas determine what  level of information is contained in their respective version of the Applicant  Guide (as each program has specific eligibility requirements) and determine  which Budget Detail Template to attach as an annex.</p>
            <p>The Applicant Guide :</p>
            <ul>
            <li>is  program specific;</li>
            <li>specifies  the level of information required to complete each section;</li>
            <li>provides  the appropriate Budget Detail Template for that program;</li>
            <li>stipulates  costs categories;</li>
            <li>outlines  eligible costs; and</li>
            <li>outlines  the level of detail required to assess the application.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The program specific Applicant  Guide outlines the documents and information that are required to be submitted  with the Application for Funding:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>application  for funding;</li>
            <li>business  and GST/HST number;</li>
            <li>amounts  owing to the Government of Canada</li>
            <li>project  description and details (including, if applicable, supporting documentation);</li>
            <li>budget;  and</li>
            <li>any  additional information listed in the Applicant Guide.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>The Application for Funding</h5>
            <p>The Application for Funding may be submitted using  a paper application or through <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>. When submitting a paper application, it must contain at least one  original signature.</p>
            <p>Applications submitted online  must follow <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr> signature requirements. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/epb/gcos/registration_guide.shtml"><abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr> Account Registration User Guide</a> for additional information.</p>
            <p>For more complex applications,  applicants may be requested to include additional information or documentation.  These additional requirements would be stipulated in the Applicant Guide. <br />
            The Application for Funding contains  the following information:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Part  1 &ndash; Organization (organization identification, contact and capacity)</li>
            <li>Part  2 &ndash; Project (identification, description and details)</li>
            <li>Part  3 &ndash; Funding (anticipated sources of contribution, budget and budget details)</li>
            <li>Part  4 - Declaration</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Part 1 &ndash; Organization</h5>
            <p>This  section of the application establishes the organization&rsquo;s identity, contact  information and collects tombstone data.</p>
            <h6>Business  and GST/HST Number. </h6>
            <p>As a legal entity, a business  is assigned a Business Number by the federal government; each identifying  number is unique to a specific business. Businesses are required to provide  their Business Numbers to the Department when entering into an agreement.</p>
            <p>If applicable, when asking an  applicant their Business Number and their GST/HST number, the nine-digit first  part as well as the extension beginning with the two letters (e.g. &lsquo;RT)&rsquo; is the  required information. An example of a Business Number with the GST/HST account  number is <strong>123456789 RT0001.</strong></p>
            <p>If a potential applicant does  business i. Quebec, the Business Number does not include the GST/HST  accounts because<a href="http://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/a-propos/"> <em>Revenu  Qu&eacute;bec</em></a> administers GST/HST on behalf o. CRA.</p>
            <p>Please refer to th. <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/bn-ne/wrks-eng.html"><em>Canada Revenue  Agency website</em></a> for additional information on CRA Business Number.</p>
            <p>Organizations that do not have  a business number cannot apply for funding using <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>. In addition, applicants who  want to use the <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr> must register for an account.</p>
            <h6>Amounts Owing to  the Government of Canada</h6>
            <p>Program delivery  staff must ensure that applicants complete the <em>Declaration - Amounts Owing to the Government of Canada</em> section of  the Application for Funding paper form, or when applying via <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>, complete the  &ldquo;Amounts Due&rdquo; screen.</p>
            <p>The term &ldquo;amounts  owing&rdquo; refers to debts with the federal government.  It is necessary,  therefore, to find out from an applicant if they are in this situation before  any applications for future funding can be considered.  If they do have an  outstanding debt, program delivery staff should ensure steps have been taken by  the organization to repay their debt before their application can be accepted.</p>
            <p>Should it be discovered,  following the signing of an agreement, that the organization has an outstanding  debt with the Federal government, they would be considered in a default situation.  The &lsquo;Default&rsquo; clause contained within the  agreement would then apply and corrective action, including termination, may be  warranted. Please refer to The Funding Agreement Chapter of the Operations  Guide for additional information.</p>
            <p>Action must also be taken in  the following situation relative to applicants in default with other federal  departments or agencies:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>If  they declare they have amounts owing to other federal departments or agencies,  and the amount owing is significant, the Department&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officer Branch (<abbr>CFOB</abbr>) must be provided with a copy of the application form.</li>
            <li><abbr title="Chief Financial Officer Branch">CFOB</abbr> will then attempt to identify the status of the amount owing to the other  department or agency.

            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Project Objectives:</strong> this is one of the most important sections of the application, the  project objectives must be clearly linked to the objectives of the program(s)  to which the applicant is applying, identify a specific outcome that the  project is designed to accomplish and identify who will benefit from the  project.  Well defined objectives are <strong>S.M.A.R.T.</strong>:  specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based.. Again, it is important that project activities  and objectives be clearly described, and should this not be the case,  clarification from the applicant should be requested. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Project Activities</strong> must be clearly linked to the objectives of the project and should include:
            <ul>

            <li>who will benefit, and how.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The expected<strong> Project Results</strong> of the project must be  clearly linked to the project objectives.   Expected results further define and often quantify the project  objectives.  They describe the tangible  results that will occur as a result of the Government&rsquo;s investment in the  project. You must ensure that the  expected results are:
            <ul>
            <li>clearly written; </li>
            <li>tangible; </li>
            <li>measurable; </li>
            <li>realistic/attainable;  and </li>
            <li>related  to the project activities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It should be demonstrated that the applicant has the knowledge and resources to evaluate the  project, or offers a provision in the application for securing the required  expertise.

            <ul>
            <li>Outcomes
            <ul>
            <li>the  anticipated number of  participant/clients served (if applicable);</li>
            <li>the  number and percentage of participants expected to achieve the outcome;</li>
            <li>the  number and percentage of returns to work or school; and</li>
            <li>the  results of intervention (in addition to participant outcomes, results could  also include short, medium and long-term impacts, direct or indirect impacts,  etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For  Research, Policy, or Community Development type projects, the following are  also considered as expected outputs:

            <li>tools,  products, systems; and/or</li>
            <li>strategies. </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Outcomes:
            <ul>
            <li>greater  collaboration amongst stakeholders;</li>
            <li>increased  capacity of all service providers related to the project; and</li>
            <li>community  members will have access to XX up-to-date tools and resources.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Outputs:
            <ul>

            <li>a  minimum of 20 participants will be trained in public speaking and will deliver  community presentations in various meetings.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>Project Details</strong> will include  information on<strong>:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Results  measurement indicators;</li>
            <li>how  the project relates to the ongoing work of the organization;</li>
            <li>partnerships  with other organizations;</li>
            <li>whether  it meets regional, national and local priorities; and</li>
            <li>the  environmental impact. </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Part 3 &ndash; Funding</h5>
            <p>The Department uses the information provided in the  section to assess the overall cost of the proposed project.</p>
            <h6>The Budget</h6>
            <p>In many ways, a budget is like  a financial snapshot of the full application; it is one of the most important,  and most detailed, pieces of the application package.  The budget,  therefore, should be reviewed carefully&mdash;both in its entirety and item by  item&mdash;to ensure it is complete, accurate, reasonable, represents fair market  value and the best value for money. In fact, a well-planned budget  enables an organization to complete required tasks on time and in a  cost-effective manner.</p>
            <p>If applicants are applying via <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>, they must provide details on how the project will be funded in the  appropriate screens. </p>
            <h6>Budget Detail Template</h6>
            <p>For contribution programs, there are three (3) Budget Detail Templates (Set  A &ndash; General, Set A for Opportunities Fund and Skills Link and Set B). For grants  programs, there are two (2) Budget Detail Templates (Set A - General and Set  B). These Budget  Detail Templates replace all existing &ldquo;Budget Negotiation Notes&rdquo; and ensure a  consistent approach to budget and information collection at the time of  application. These streamlined templates include a general listing based on  cost categories.</p>
            <p>The appropriate Budget Detail  Template (based on the standard sets of cost categories) is attached to the  Applicant Guide (as an Annex).</p>
            <h6>Cost Category Sets</h6>
            <p>All contribution programs (with the exception of Canada Summer Jobs program) are required to use one of  two cost category sets depending upon program funding types, Set A or Set B.  Set A has a general structure as well as an option specific to Opportunities  Fund for Persons with Disabilities and Skills Link programs to support the flat  rate costing option for certain cost categories. Set A is structured to support  programs for which organizations must report separately on administrative costs  (also known as indirect costs) and direct costs. For programs which follow Set  B, this distinction is not required.</p>
            <p>All grants programs are also  required to use one of the two cost category sets depending upon program  funding types: Set A and Set B for grant  programs.</p>
            <p>Refer to the complete list of  programs, funding types, applicable cost category sets and Questions and  Answers (Qs &amp; As) regarding departmental flat rate for Skills Link and  Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities (<abbr>OF</abbr>) found on the <abbr title="Centre of Expertise">CoE</abbr> website.</p>
            <p>The appropriate cost category  sets are included in all paper and electronic forms for the application for  funding and the agreement. When projects are entered into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> the  appropriate cost category structure will appear.</p>
            <p>The following is a summary of  the cost category sets for grants and contributions:</p>
            <p><strong>Set A &ndash; General</strong> cost  category structure supports programs where organizations must report separately  on administrative (indirect) and direct costs.</p>

            <p>These cost category sets:</p>

            <li>provide  common standard definitions;</li>
            <li>reduce  differences and inconsistencies in reporting requirements from one program to  another;</li>
            <li>reduce  internal and external administrative burden;</li>
            <li>create  a <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> database containing information on project costs and expenditures that  assist in program reporting, analysis and design; and</li>
            <li>reduce  the number of amendments required to deal with adjustments between budget cost  categories.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To assist both applicants and  program delivery staff in determining what types of expenditures are eligible,  and which categories and sub-categories various costs correspond to, a standard  eligible cost listing for each cost category set has been developed.</p>
            <p>A comprehensive budget  includes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Proposed  expenditure start and end dates (or, the funding period). It is important to  discuss these dates with the applicant so that if the project is approved, the  dates can be readily confirmed when the agreement is prepared. Always make the  applicant aware that no costs can be incurred before the start and after the  end dates of the agreement funding period. For this reason, the Department  needs to know at the application stage if there will be a start-up or close-out  period, along with essential project-related expenditures.</li>
            <li>A  detailed breakdown of expenses and descriptions of cost categories, such as  staff wages, capital and project costs and participant costs. This section  should also specify which costs, if any, will be sub-projects administrative  costs (i.e. the applicant's use of a third party to perform all or part of the  project activities that make up an agreement), and if any flat rates are  applicable.</li>
            <li>For  projects under Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities (<abbr>OF</abbr>) and Skills  Link programs, a verification by program delivery staff that, if  applicable (when an organization chooses this costing option), the flat rate  has been calculated accurately and applied only to the cost categories for  which a flat rate is possible. Specific expenditures covered by flat rates do  not need to be detailed or negotiated at the time of application. Consult Questions and Answers regarding departmental flat  rates for Skills Link and Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities (<abbr>OF</abbr>)  for how to calculate flat rate and other questions relating to flat rate.</li>
            <li>A  declaration, by potential organizations, of other sources of funding regardless  of the amount of the contribution requested from the Department. Other  funders are active supporters of the project who contribute time and resources,  and who have an interest in the outcome. Evidence of partnership includes:
            <ul>
            <li>financial (cash or in-kind) contribution;</li>
            <li>contribution of human  resources for project delivery;</li>
            <li>joint delivery of a project or  service; and</li>
            <li>capital investment.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>An  explanation as to the value of in-kind contributions and why the  contribution is required.
            <ul>
            <li>In-kind contributions are  goods or services provided by the organization or by other organizations and  partners; these could include land, and goods required to carry out projects  and activities. Generally, these can be considered if they are new or  incremental assets provided for the project, are specific to the project, are  quantifiable, and are essential to the project going forward.</li>
            <li>To assess the value of the  cash or in-kind contributions from other sources, program delivery staff can:
            <ul>
            <li>refer to the available local  labour market information when assessing wage contributions;</li>
            <li>consult supplier valuation for  identical or similar materials, equipment or products;</li>
            <li>compare proposed rent costs to  the going rates for similar space in the geographic location; and</li>
            <li>ensure travel costs are related to the project and necessary for project success and ensure that the  project funds are only paying for the amount of space required for project  activities.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In order to complete the assessment, confirmation of commitment from partnering organizations  identifying the amount of financial or in-kind contribution must be  submitted. Incorporating this  information into the application phase will prove beneficial during the  agreement set up and monitoring phase.</li>
            <li>For more information on in-kind, please refer to the Guide on In-Kind Contribution.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If  an applicant identifies the need for advance payments, a completed <a href="http://forms-formulaires.prv/eform99/forms/FF99/ESDC-EMP5538(2014-07-003)E.pdf">Forecast of Project Expenditures</a> must be submitted. This  forecast indicates the expected expenditures for each reporting period. All new  advance paying contribution projects entered in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, (with the exception of  Canada Summer Jobs program) will use the forecast of project expenditures to  track anticipated agreement expenses for specific, pre-determined fixed payment  periods. For more information on Forecast of Project Expenditures, please refer  to the Activity Reporting and Payment Chapter of the Operations Guide. The  forecast of project expenditures is required to prepare a contribution  agreement.</li>
            <li>Project  cost details: every applicant must provide a list of costs eligible for  reimbursement and a breakdown of how these were determined. This  information should be kept in the project file for future financial  monitoring. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Program delivery staff involved in guiding and reviewing an applicant&rsquo;s budget development process  should also advise them of the following considerations:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Budgetary dollar values and project costs in applications, forecast of project  expenditures, or negotiated agreements are not necessarily equal to actual  costs reimbursed. Actual costs incurred and claimed by the applicant may vary  from budgeted costs. The Department will only reimburse up to the actual costs  incurred.</li>
            <li>As  an exception to the &lsquo;reimburse up to the actual costs incurred&rsquo; rule, the  Department has developed and implemented a flat rate option for the  Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities (OF) and the Skills Link  programs. The use of the flat rate has impacts throughout the project life  cycle. Within these categories, specific costs do not need to be detailed or  negotiated at the time of application, nor are they subject to  monitoring.  The flat rate expenditures do not require to be supported by  additional documentation. The amount eligible for reimbursement for these  categories is simply based on a given percentage of the total amount of other  categories.  Please refer to the FMPR Desk Aid.</li>
            <li>Applicants should be notified that administrative costs, not directly related to the  proposed project activities but necessary for the organization to function  effectively, may be eligible for reimbursement. The requirements for whether  administrative costs must be separately reported from 3. Direct Costs, c)  Project Costs varies by program (see programs and associated cost category set  list for more details; those following Set A separate these costs, while those  following Set B do not).</li>
            <li>Applicants may not have to provide invoices, back-up calculations, accounting records,  etc. in support of a claim.  They must, however, keep this supporting  documentation available for possible review by the Department at a later date,  possibly within the context of project monitoring, with the exception of  expenditures where flat rate applies (categories subject to flat rate are not  monitored).</li>
            <li>Applicants must obtain written, departmental approval for goods or services contracts of  $25,000 or more (before taxes), or for contracts with businesses or individuals  associated with the contribution organization.</li>
            <li>Applicants must disclose and receive written approval before subcontracting any part of  project activities. For further details on contracting and the use of  sub-contractors, please consult <a href="http://dialogue/grp/DGDPF-CFOB-PolFin-FinPol/Departmental%20Financial%20Policy%20Archives/CFO%20grants%20and%20contribution%20(2004)%20en.docx">section 5.21 of the <abbr title="Chief Financial Officer Branch">CFOB</abbr> Grants and  Contributions Policy</a>.</li>
            <li>Finally,  applicants must use a fair, transparent and competitive process when procuring goods  and services for the project, or when subcontracting project activities, where  the value is $25,000 or more (before taxes). If they do not intend to use a  competitive process, a written justification for a sole-source approach must be  provided to, and subsequently approved by the Department&rsquo;s delegated authority.  Column B, before proceeding.</li>

            <h5>Part 4 &ndash; Declaration</h5>
            <p>The Application for Funding must be signed by an official, authorized  representative of the organization and must  be signed in accordance with the organization&rsquo;s statutes, by-laws or other  constituting documents.</p>
            <h4>5.3 Role of Program Delivery Staff</h4>
            <h5>The Application Phase</h5>
            <p>Regardless of the application  intake method, the role of program delivery staff is both to promote government  programs, and to assist potential organizations with inquires about the  application process or the program to which they are applying.  In order to fulfill this role, staff should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>describe</strong> the scope, benefits and limitations of the program  so that potential applicants can decide whether or not to proceed with an  application;</li>
            <li><strong>interpret</strong> and have knowledge of program terms and  conditions to ensure the proposed project will help realize the goals of the  program, the organization and the community;</li>
            <li><strong>guide</strong> applicants through the application process,  and inform them of the assessment and approval process;</li>
            <li><strong>clarify</strong> the logistics - format, number of copies,  timelines, and address for application submission; and</li>
            <li><strong>respond</strong> to applicant questions and be  available for consultation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: The role of program delivery staff may vary according to program specific needs or variances between national  and regional delivery.</p>
            <h5>Maintaining Objectivity</h5>
            <p>Throughout the application  development stage, program delivery staff must ensure they respect the  Government of Canada&rsquo;s obligation to remain accountable to Canadians for the  best use of public funds. </p>
            <p>When working with potential  organizations, there exist a number of potential situations which program  delivery staff should avoid. Some examples include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>telling  an organization exactly what it should or should not do;</li>
            <li>completing  the application for the organization;</li>
            <li>taking  sides with one faction of a group or community against another;</li>
            <li>promoting  project funding for organizations with which one is personally associated;</li>
            <li>attempting  to solve organizational problems through the use of project funds; and</li>
            <li>becoming an advocate for an applicant before such time that an  application can be recommended for funding. </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Ensuring Complete Applications</h5>
            <p>An important  aspect of the role of program delivery staff is to review and identify any  missing information. Incomplete applications can result in delays to the  assessment process; negative decisions based on a lack of information, and  missed funding deadlines.</p>
            <h5>Receiving and  Acknowledging Applications</h5>
            <p>The  Department can receive applications either through a paper process or via <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>. <br />
            When receiving a paper  application, program delivery staff must:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>ensure it includes a signed  departmental <a href="http://forms-formulaires.prv/eform99/forms/FF99/ESDC-EMP5523(2013-04-003)E.pdf">Application for Funding</a> and any other documentation  required under the specific program terms and conditions, all duly completed  and signed by the applicant;</li>
            <li>stamp the date of receipt on  the hard copy of the application or proposal and if applicable, keep the  envelop and/or e-mail for future reference;</li>
            <li>enter the application  information into the Project Set-up phase of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>;</li>
            <li>open a paper file and record  the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> file number on the application. The signed application for funding and  all hard copies of accompanying documentation may be placed on the paper file  or scanned and uploaded into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>; and</li>
            <li>send an acknowledgement letter  or email to the applicant confirming receipt of the application. The letter may  also include additional information such as the number assigned to the file,  the name and telephone number of the program delivery staff responsible for  assessing the application, or a request for any missing documentation. A copy  should be kept in the electronic or paper file. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>All paper applications received for national or  regional <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> programs with continuous intake should be inputted into the  Common System for Grants and Contributions (<abbr>CSGC</abbr>) within two (2) business days  of receipt.</p>
            <p>Note that the Department has  implemented an &lsquo;Acknowledgment of Application&rsquo; service standard, applicable to  all departmental <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> programs, which states that:</p>
            <p><em>&ldquo;Under normal conditions, the  Department will acknowledge receipt of your proposal within 21 calendar days of  receiving your application package.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p>Program delivery staff must  record the application received date, as well as the date that the  acknowledgement was sent to applicant in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>. Two  mandatory fields exist in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> &ndash; &lsquo;Application Received Date&rsquo; (located in the Project Setup/Project Summary  phase of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>/<abbr title="Project Life Cycle">PLC</abbr> process) and &lsquo;Acknowledgement Letter Sent&rsquo; (located in the Project Maintenance/Project  Events phase).. </p>
            <p>For further details, please  consult the ESDC Grants and Contributions Service Standards  Directive</p>
            <p>When receiving applications via <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>, the process is automated.  Confirmation  of receipt of applications submitted electronically is displayed on the screen  and sent by e-mail to applicants once the application has been successfully  submitted. </p>
            <p>Once  the electronic application and supporting documents (if applicable), have been  submitted via <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>, it is routed to the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> staging area for the responsible  office. From there, program delivery staff will review it and determine if it  is a valid application for the program. If so, program delivery staff will  import the file into <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> and populate the appropriate <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> screens.</p>
            <p>Electronic applications received  by <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr> should be uploaded from the staging area within two (2) business days  of receipt.</p>
            <p>Please  refer to the Operational Directive on the Streamlined Application Process, Approval Request Form and  Approval Process for Grants and Contributions Programs.</p>
            <h5>Opening the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> and Project File</h5>
            <p>In addition to entering or  importing (if submitted electronically via <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>) an application for funding into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, a paper file is required in order to safeguard any paper originals.</p>
            <h6>Paper vs Electronic Files</h6>
            <p>As the Department continues to  move away from a paper based process, we are now communicating and receiving  documents electronically (e.g. receiving information through e-mail or <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>).  Paper and/or electronic documents  together make up the project file.  The  Department does not expect that every electronic correspondence be printed and  saved in a paper file.  Electronic  documents should be saved in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> under the appropriate section, while hard  copies of documents should be saved in the physical project file.  The two files do not have to mirror one  another; however, together they must have all the required elements of a  complete project file.</p>
            <p>All information submitted by  an organization, via <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>, is imported through the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> staging area; therefore  hard copies of these documents are not required in the paper file since they  can be retrieved virtually through the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 6. Assessment</h3>
            </summary>
            <p><em>Referring to the 2012 Ops Guide, Chapter 5</em></p>
            <p>Assessment is a criteria-based process that helps program delivery staff evaluate the relative merit of funding applications and explain the resulting recommendations to applicants, the public, and departmental and ministerial authorities. It allows the Department to assess the strengths and weaknesses of an application, and to select those applications most deserving of funding. </p>
            <p> While criteria may vary from program to program, it must be determined that the application:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>meets program terms and conditions and planning priorities as defined by relevant local, regional and national business or operational plans;</li>
            <li>responds to an identified need or specific issue;</li>
            <li>is realistic in what it intends to do and the outcomes it expects to achieve;</li>
            <li>provides good value for funding requested (consider what is being achieved vis-à- vis the amount requested; are projected costs comparable to fair market value);</li>
            <li>includes partnerships that will reduce certain costs within the proposed project, if applicable;</li>
            <li>demonstrates that the applicant has the capacity to successfully complete the proposed project;</li>
            <li>is compliant with all applicable federal, provincial and municipal laws, by-laws and regulations;</li>
            <li>ensures that all permits, licenses, consents and other authorizations will be obtained prior to the commencement of the project;</li>
            <li>entails an acceptable level of risk; and,</li>
            <li>meets all requirements under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The assessment process ensures that all applications are evaluated against program prerequisites, client and community needs, availability of funds and current year goals. It results in a clear rationale that demonstrates how every aspect of the application has been measured objectively against established criteria, and decisions have been made in a consistent manner. It must not only be fair, but also perceived as such by way of a transparent process that demonstrates accountability and ensures decisions are documented, communicated and open to public scrutiny. Without a clear rationale and a transparent process for choosing one project over another, applicants may feel unfairly treated and seek remedy within the Department, through Members of Parliament, or through the media.</p>
            <p>Assessment also provides for communication between the Department and the applicant in order to clarify program requirements, and discuss potential risks and risk mitigation strategies. This kind of discussion with the applicant, the community and other funders may reveal new information regarding the project or the applicant, which may possibly affect the successful outcome of the project.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, a thorough assessment will support the result of a funding agreement that is clear, specific, easier to monitor, and, consequently, more likely to achieve expected results. In situations where an assessment has not been utilized to clearly identify the conditions for approval, and help set the expected milestones and outcomes, monitoring becomes more complex, and the risk where achieving expected results is concerned increases.</p>

            <h4>6.1 Conducting the Assessment</h4>
            <p>The assessment process may differ from program to program and region to region. In some instances, an internal – and if required, an external – assessment committee or board is used to evaluate large numbers of applications; however, in most cases, program delivery staff in charge of the file—possibly in consultation with colleagues—are responsible for this task.</p>
            <p>Whether the project is assessed individually or by a group, the process usually involves two readings of the applications at hand:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The first reading determines if the project seems feasible and well developed, and meets basic program criteria and applicant eligibility requirements.</li>
            <li>The second reading is a complete and thorough assessment of every aspect of the application, including detailed information about the applicant, the project and the degree of associated risk.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>The First Reading</h5>
            <p>During a first reading, either program delivery staff or the internal assessment committee develops a general first impression of the application quality, and determines whether it meets community needs in a practical way. This preliminary stage helps anyone involved evaluate applications based on their knowledge of program and departmental priorities, and their experience with this applicant as well as other applicants. First readings are particularly useful when a large number of applications are being considered.</p>
            <p>Remember to objectively assess the substance of the application. Although a clearly written application can often reflect an applicant’s general organizational ability, an application should not be accepted or rejected based solely on its presentation.</p>
            <p>As the application is reviewed, program delivery staff should be able to answer the following questions in the affirmative:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Does the application meet program terms and conditions?</li>
            <li>Does it fit within the Department's Integrated Business Plan?</li>
            <li>Is the applicant eligible?</li>
            <li>Does the project seem reasonable and realistic?</li>
            <li>Are the activities feasible, given the proposed time frame and budget?</li>
            <li>Does the project address identified needs and avoid duplication of existing initiatives (of which program delivery staff are aware)?</li>
            <li>Does it answer the "who, what, where, when, how and why" questions?</li>
            <li>Are the risks manageable?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When necessary (and when program-specific guidelines allow), contact applicants at any point during the assessment process if further information or clarification is required; note all questions as the application is being read and then decide who can best provide the answers. Any further information received should be documented in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> and the project file, including:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the date the applicant was contacted;</li>
            <li>the name and title of the contact person;</li>
            <li>the questions that were asked;</li>
            <li>the information obtained; and,</li>
            <li>any follow up required or action taken.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After a first reading, one must decide what to do with the application:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>1. If the application is complete and has merit, it is ready for a more in-depth assessment and a second reading.</li>
            <li>2. If the application is incomplete or further information is required, one could either reject the application immediately or, if the program allows, hold the application until the necessary information from the applicant has been received.</li>
            <li>3. If the application is ineligible under the terms and conditions of the specific program or is clearly not feasible, notify the applicant in writing that the project has been rejected, and, if applicable, referred to another program or department.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>The Second Reading</h4>
            <p>Once the first reading has been accomplished and a decision to not reject the application has been made, a more detailed assessment – in the form of a second reading – needs to be performed; if program delivery staff are satisfied with the results of the second reading, the availability of funds to support the project must then be confirmed. </p>
            <p>This second reading involves a very in-depth, analytical assessment of the:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>applicant, including:
            <ul>
            <li>eligibility</li>
            <li>track record</li>
            <li>applicant stability</li>
            <li>organizational capacity</li>
            <li>relationship with the Department</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The application, including its:
            <ul>
            <li>objectives, and expected outputs and outcomes</li>
            <li>proposed activities</li>
            <li>environmental impact</li>
            <li>partnerships</li>
            <li>evaluation strategies</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>budget, including:
            <ul>
            <li>in-kind contributions</li>
            <li>stacking of assistance</li>
            <li>contracting and sub-contracting</li>
            <li>value for money</li>
            <li>eligibility of costs</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>At this stage, program delivery staff can use a generic <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> checklist or program- specific checklist to document, consolidate, track and verify information about potential applicants, application content, financial data (such as the budget), environmental aspects (when necessary), consultations and evaluation approach.</p>
            <p>Critically, throughout the process of application assessment, one must simultaneously carry out the process of risk assessment relative to each of the three above-mentioned elements and, ultimately, decide whether and how the potential risks identified could be managed, should the project be recommended for funding.</p>
            <h4>Assessing the Applicant</h4>
            <p>Just as one would need to interview any candidate for a job, so too should program delivery staff take a closer look at the applicant behind each application submitted.</p>
            <p>To do so, program delivery staff should weigh several factors when evaluating an applicant's capacity to complete the proposed project, including:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>activity performance;</li>
            <li>ability to demonstrate results;</li>
            <li>financial performance;</li>
            <li>organizational administration; and</li>
            <li>stability of the board and/or organization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Often, experts and community representatives can provide additional information about an applicant's background and suitability.</p>
            <h4>Applicant Eligibility</h4>
            <p>The first step program delivery staff must undertake is to confirm that the applicant is eligible for funding under the program terms and conditions. Consult program-specific guidelines and ensure that enough information has been received from the applicant to properly gauge their eligibility, requesting further input or clarification from the program or the applicant, as necessary.</p>
            <p>Should it be determined that the applicant is not eligible, the assessment process ends here and the application is rejected.</p>
            <h4>Applicant Track Record</h4>
            <p>To assess an applicant's track record, program delivery staff must determine whether the applicant has managed past projects similar to the one currently being proposed, and if so, to what degree desired results were achieved.</p>
            <p>Hence, previous projects—whether funded by the Department or by others—should be reviewed. This can be done by:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>asking the applicant to provide a detailed history of funding received from <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>, other federal departments and agencies, other levels of government and private organizations (should this information not already be detailed in the application);</li>
            <li>weighing the applicant's experience in carrying out similar activities in order to verify their capacity and effectiveness; ask the applicant to provide additional information or references, as required;</li>
            <li>searching the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> for information about the applicant's background and history in delivering <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>-funded projects, such as that provided via the Organization History screen or individual project close-out summary reports;</li>
            <li>reviewing the results of previous agreements held by the applicant with other federal departments or agencies, and the outcomes realized for each; and,</li>
            <li>obtaining information from other levels of government relative to their experiences with the applicant, if <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> holds memoranda of understanding with them to facilitate such information-sharing practices. Privacy considerations, however, may prevent obtaining additional details from these sources.</li>
            <li>Refer to risk factor #7, financial performance, and risk factor #8, activity performance, of the Risk Assessment Tool for supplementary guidance in this area.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Applicant Stability</h4>
            <p>Even if the applicant's track record is established with the Department, circumstances may change from one project to another; program delivery staff should, therefore, assess the current organizational stability of the applicant.</p>
            <p>To this end, one should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>review the applicant's documentation to determine if the proposed activities continue to be consistent with the organization's mission and mandate;
            <ul>
            <li>evaluate the applicant's current capacity to carry out the project:
            <ul>
            <li>Is this a new venture for the organization?</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Is there a history of previous funding?</li>
            <li>Is the organization incorporated?</li>
            <li>Does it have its own operational funding or access to credit, independent of solicited project funding?</li>
            <li>Are there risk management measures in place;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>review the organization's documentation (such as annual reports, websites, brochures, newsletters, etc.) to determine the applicant's usual client group(s);</li>
            <li>consult other organizations and stakeholder groups familiar with the applicant; and,</li>
            <li>check with local, regional and national <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> offices and other government departments.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Applicant Organizational Capacity</h4>
            <p>Program delivery staff must closely examine the capacity of an applicant in order to determine whether sufficient expertise and resources to successfully manage projects is available. If the applicant is unknown to the Department or proposes activities they have not done before, a more in-depth assessment of their overall potential to deliver expected results should be carried out.</p>
            <p>In order to complete this task, the following factors should be assessed:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>administrative setup;</li>
            <li>ability to maintain financial and internal controls; and,</li>
            <li>status in the Departmental Accounts Receivable System (DARS)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Refer to risk factor #4, organizational administration, and risk factor #5, stability of the board and/or organization of the Risk Assessment, Management and Mitigation (RAMM) Tool for supplementary guidance in this area.</p>
            <h4>Administrative Setup</h4>
            <p>The examination of certain aspects of an organization's administration can be revealing when assessing whether the managers and employees have the necessary resources, supports, skills, training and expertise required to carry out the proposed project. </p>
            <p>During a review of the applicant's administrative capacity:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>confirm the organization has a system of administrative policies and practices in place to effectively manage the project;</li>
            <li>examine the current organizational structure or payroll to ascertain whether it has the employees necessary to complete the proposed activities; if not, does the application make provisions to obtain such expertise; and,</li>
            <li>determine whether requested funding will supplement (and not replace) the organization's normal operating budget and support staff to lead project activities; specifically, this can be done by:
            <ul>
            <li>reviewing, if available, the organization's financial statements or budgets from the two previous years; and,</li>
            <li>identifying, if possible, other sources of funding for ongoing organizational activities such as revenues, operating funds from other sources, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Ability to Maintain Financial and Internal Controls</h4>
            <p>Managers rely on coordinated financial and internal controls to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial data;</li>
            <li>promote operational efficiency and adherence to stated policy; and,</li>
            <li>safeguard assets against errors, waste and fraud.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Typically, there are four main types of controls:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>organization;</li>
            <li>segregation function;</li>
            <li>finance and accounting; and,</li>
            <li>additional safeguards.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Within this context, the effectiveness of an organization's financial and internal controls can be assessed by:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> investigating the organization's record-keeping practices and internal controls to measure its ability to remain accountable for the use of <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> funds; and, </li>
            <li>reviewing, if available, its financial statements for the past two years, including the balance sheet, income statement and forecast of project expenditures for the coming year (seek the advice of a financial officer whenever these statements are consolidated or complex). </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Organization Controls</h4>
            <p>These controls reflect whether the organization has appropriate human resource practices due to the existence of:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>effective hiring practices;</li>
            <li>adequate training programs;</li>
            <li>appropriate supervision;</li>
            <li>objective performance standards;</li>
            <li>fair and equitable evaluation and promotion practices; and,</li>
            <li>effective, tamper-proof systems that discourage abuse.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Segregation of Function Controls</h4>
            <p>Basically, such controls ensure no one employee is ever in a position that enables them to perpetrate and conceal irregularities or fraud. Incompatible functions, for example, should be separated – the same person cannot make out cheques, sign them, record them in the register and perform the bank reconciliation function. In smaller organizations, two individuals should be required to sign cheques.</p>
            <p>Ideally, large organizations are planned or structured to segregate internal control functions from operational functions. For example, accounting functions remain distinct from operational functions when an accountant maintains financial records and a manager makes decisions relative to daily operations. Note here that some departmental programs may require that the applicant identify the person responsible for accounting functions within the organization.</p>
            <p>As far as possible, organizations should always separate groups that have access to assets from those who authorize purchases.</p>
            <h4>Finance and Accounting Controls</h4>
            <p>Typically, large organizations segregate finance, or treasury, functions (such as paying bills) from accounting, or controller, functions (such as recording transactions) so that the same person cannot issue cheques, sign them and record them in the financial account ledgers. Note that applicants are generally required to identify those with legal signing authority for the organization.</p>
            <p>Possible accounting controls include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>self-balancing features incorporated into the use of the subsidiary and general ledgers, where the subsidiary ledger entries balance with a main control account;</li>
            <li>arrangements where one employee reviews the work of another – for example, the bookkeeper prepares cheques and the manager spot-checks invoices prior to payment; and,</li>
            <li>restricted ability to make journal entries, where only authorized individuals have access to financial records.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Additional Safeguard Controls</h4>
            <p>These could include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>restricting access to assets such as computer terminals;</li>
            <li>periodically comparing assets on hand to recorded amounts by inventory counts;</li>
            <li>confirming book balance with bank account balance (or, bank reconciliation);</li>
            <li>protecting records by keeping bookkeeping records in a safe place;</li>
            <li>obtaining insurance coverage; and,</li>
            <li>analyzing the debt load carried by the organization to determine its ability to meet forecast of project expenditures requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Status in DARS</h4>
            <p>At this stage, program delivery staff must check the Departmental Accounts Receivable System (<abbr>DARS</abbr>) to ensure the applicant organization has no outstanding debts. If debts to the Crown exist, they must always be taken into account whenever new applications are assessed in order to support:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>the sound management of contribution overpayments;</li>
            <li>accountability for public funds ; and,</li>
            <li>consistent and equitable treatment of all applicants.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To do this, review screen DW009 to verify there is no existing overpayment to the applicant. This confirmation should be printed and included in the physical file.</p>
            <p>However, if DW009 indicates an overpayment, consult screen DC001 (using the client identification number) to obtain further information.</p>
            <p>Where the applicant is an organization, they must either repay the outstanding balance, or negotiate an acceptable repayment arrangement, before any new funding agreement can be put in place. Carefully document the status of any repayment situation in the project file.</p>
            <p>Individuals who have an existing overpayment in default with the Department should, as much as possible, negotiate a repayment schedule before requesting new funding from the Department.</p>
            <p>However, it is recognized that some programs provide funding to individuals who are unemployed or who are experiencing hardship. By assisting these clients through an intervention there is an expectation that upon successful completion of the project they would be able to secure employment and repay the debt. Hence, under such circumstances, individuals with an outstanding overpayment would not be required to have a repayment schedule in place in order to be eligible for assistance.</p>
            <h4>Relationship with the Department</h4>
            <p>Employer-employee relationships must not be created between the Department and the funding organization.</p>
            <p>To determine if such a relationship could develop, review the application to assess whether any of the following questions can be answered in the affirmative; the more so the case, the greater the possibility that an employer-employee relationship may develop. Carefully analyse and address this possibility before recommending funding.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Will <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> exercise supervisory control (as distinct from inspection of work) over the organization? That is, does it exercise control not only over what is done (the objective), but how, when and where the work is carried out?</li>
            <li>Will <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> have the power to discipline the organization's staff, make hiring and firing decisions or become involved in sub-contracting project activities? In other words, is the Department limiting the applicant's opportunity or authority to hire or contract staff as needed to carry out activities?</li>
            <li>Will <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> be responsible for training the organization's staff? (It is, however, acceptable for <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> to contribute to the cost of professional development for the applicant's staff if it is only a small portion of the total contribution to the applicant, and if the training is necessary and relevant to project activities.)</li>
            <li>Will <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> make payments to an organization on the basis of time, at regular intervals, directly to individuals (i.e. staff), subject to source deductions? The Department can only reimburse eligible costs as they are incurred by the organization (so the costs are the organization's, not the Department’s) and does not remunerate the organization or their staff.</li>
            <li>Is there evidence that the Public Service Employment Act may be contravened? Project activities must not be the same as or similar to the Department's activities, and the organization cannot perform departmental duties and functions. The Act defines the process that federal departments must use to hire staff and does not allow the use of contribution funds to pay individuals to perform tasks that would normally be completed by a federal employee.</li>
            <li>Will <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> be responsible for providing tools, equipment, material, premises or facilities to the organization?</li>
            <li>Will the organization or their staff attend internal departmental meetings? Are they on internal departmental communications systems (such as email)?</li>
            <li>Will the organization be integrated into <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> as an organization and the work being performed become an integral part of the Department’s work? Project activities must not be seen as part of departmental operations (for example, located on departmental premises; in close proximity without being clearly set off as a separate facility; or exhibiting signs that infer the organization is part of the Department). Moreover, organizations must never suggest to clients, either explicitly or implicitly, that they are working for or representing <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>.</li>
            <li>Could the organization profit from their involvement in the project? An organization should have no opportunity to profit from their activities, as <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> can only reimburse actual costs.</li>
            <li>Could the organization be exposed to any risk of loss while performing their work? An organization could incur costs which exceed the Department’s contribution, which could mean that they may suffer a loss. Similarly, they might also suffer a liability—through errors and omissions, wrongful dismissal, property damage, personal injury, etc.—that becomes a loss. Whatever the case, these losses must only be borne by the organization and not by the Department, which can only reimburse the cost of liability insurance that would protect the organization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Consultation with Experts and Community Representatives</h4>
            <p>Consultations with experts are sometimes necessary in order to understand the proposed project as it relates to the applicant, departmental priorities, other funders' commitments and community support for the initiative. In these situations, applicants must be informed, in advance, that experts will be consulted to verify information and solicit their assistance in evaluating the application.</p>
            <p>Throughout these consultation activities, the need to maintain confidentiality and privacy must remain paramount. While program delivery staff may have to disclose some application details for consultation purposes, one must ensure that information protected under the Privacy Act remains confidential.</p>
            <p>The consultation process usually involves the following recommended procedures:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Consult the applicant first: develop a list of questions, based on the application, for which you require more information. Document all written and verbal contacts, including discussions, in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> and paper file. As often as practical, rely on written documentation over verbal communication in order to establish a paper trail.</li>
            <li>Within the Department, talk to other program delivery staff who have dealt with the applicant, or similar project activities, in the past to assess their record of success and community impact.</li>
            <li>Liaise with potential co-funders to foster cooperative relationships and avoid any duplication of funding. Confirm the source and nature of other funding resources by speaking to co-funders, project partners and other government departments.</li>
            <li>Contact community, stakeholder and local government representatives directly to gauge their support for the project (if such support is required by program terms and conditions or guidelines). Discuss the value of the project as well as any concerns or unresolved issues.</li>
            <li>Ensure the applicant has obtained union concurrence—in writing—if proposed activities will be held in a workplace with a collective agreement, as this is a funding condition.</li>
            <li>Contact the applicant to clarify all concerns and issues raised during consultations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>6.2 Assessing the Application</h4>
            <p>Perhaps the most critical component of the assessment process, an application is key to understanding how a project would unfold. Ideally, it delineates a course of action that will deliver—and measure—expected results.</p>
            <p>When assessing an application, program delivery staff should look for project effectiveness and efficiency while also considering the RAMM factors associated with project activities. This involves analyzing its various aspects, including:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>activity performance;</li>
            <li>project duration;</li>
            <li>complexity of proposed activities;</li>
            <li>involvement of partners;</li>
            <li>public sensitivity;</li>
            <li>possible environmental impact; and,</li>
            <li>planned evaluation strategies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Proposed Activities</h5>
            <p>When assessing proposed activities, answer the following questions with respect to these areas of particular concern:</p>
            <p>Program parameters, strategic priorities and compliance with laws:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Do they currently meet program terms and conditions, and priorities (or should they be refined or modified)?</li>
            <li>How do they compare with local, regional and national priorities, as identified in the integrated business plan and local strategic plan?</li>
            <li>Do they respond to identified needs within the community?</li>
            <li>Are the activities compliant with all applicable federal, provincial and municipal laws, by-laws and regulations?</li>
            <li>Has the applicant obtain all permits, licenses, consents and other authorizations that are necessary to carry out the project?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Project objectives and expected results:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Have they been clearly defined within a reasonable timeframe?</li>
            <li>Are they measurable in terms of time, output and anticipated outcomes?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Eligible activities:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Are they necessary?</li>
            <li>Are they feasible?</li>
            <li>Are they well defined?</li>
            <li>Are they described in sufficient detail as part of a well-conceived implementation plan?</li>
            <li>Do they represent the most effective way to meet project goals and identified needs?</li>
            <li>Are the roles and responsibilities of project staff and partners clearly defined?</li>
            <li>Has the applicant identified the means by which participant eligibility will be identified?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scheduled timeframes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Can they be completed within the specified timeframe?</li>
            <li>Are the timelines too generous?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Potential for duplication:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Would the proposed activities duplicate a product or service already existing in the community according to your knowledge of the labour market, community services and activity sector?</li>
            <li>Are there similar undertakings in the area?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Potential for unfair competition:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Will <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> assistance to this particular project adversely impact any other local or national initiatives or businesses similar to what is being proposed?</li>
            <li>What do community and industry stakeholders (such as the chamber of commerce or board of trade, municipal government, local business and social service associations) say?</li>
            <li>Can the applicant demonstrate (in detail via the application) that the requested funds will not result in an unfair advantage over any other organization or competitor?</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Official Languages</h5>
            <p>Section 6.5.13 of the Treasury Board Policy on Transfer Payments, requires departments to ensure that programs meet the obligations of the Government of Canada as prescribed in the Official Languages Act (<abbr>OLA</abbr>) at the time of both their design and implementation.</p>
            <p>A decision by the Supreme Court of Canada states that measures to respect the formal and substantive equality of both official languages should also apply.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff must, in assessing the application using the three-question grid below, check for the need or desirability for the project to cater to members of both official languages communities or provide services in both official languages.</p>
            <p>To facilitate this assessment, the application should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>clearly identify the linguistic profile of the beneficiaries targeted by the project;</li>
            <li>document any specific needs of the official language minority communities and specify how the project will meet these needs; and,</li>
            <li>demonstrate that the applicant has the necessary human and financial resources to meet the specific needs of official language minority communities.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Questions for determining whether the applicant’s project should cater to members of both official language communities or provide services in both official languages? Yes/No</h5>
            <ol>
            <li>Are there individuals or groups from both official language communities among the targeted beneficiaries of the project?</li>
            <li>In regard to the general public of the locality or localities targeted by the project, is there a significant demand for services in both official languages?</li>
            <li>If, by its very nature, the project is for a single language group, would it be desirable to promote it to the other group?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If the answer to any one of these three questions is ‘yes’, one must consider that the applicant’s project should cater to members of both official language communities or provide services in both official languages and official languages obligations should be reflected in the funding agreement.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>"Formal equality" is achieved when members of official language minority communities and those of the majority community are treated the same way by providing identical services in English and French. ’Substantive equality’ is achieved when taking into consideration the specific needs of the minority community by providing activities or services with different content or using a different delivery method to ensure that the minority receives services of the same quality as the majority.</li>
            <li>The targeted beneficiaries of the project are defined as follows: individuals, organizations or people that can benefit from the activity or service.</li>
            <li>The localities that are the subject of a ’significant demand’ for services in both official languages are identified by the Burolis tool. Please refer to it as required.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Environmental Impact</h5>
            <p>The <em>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (<abbr>CEAA</abbr>)</em> applies to any activity for which <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> is the responsible authority, whether as a project proponent, regulator, source of funding or land. The Act ensures the environmental effects of federal projects receive early consideration in the planning process, and provides opportunities for public consultation.</p>
            <p>At <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>, environmental issues are taken into account during both the assessment and monitoring phases of the project life cycle; no project can be approved unless it is unlikely to cause significant adverse environmental effects, and public concern about its environmental impact is minimal.</p>
            <p>For every potential <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>-funded project, program delivery staff must determine whether it will require a formal environmental assessment (<abbr>EA</abbr>), as per the requirements of the Act, prior to funding approval. In order to ensure that projects conform to the requirements of the <abbr title="Canadian Environmental Assessment Act">CEAA</abbr>, responsible program delivery staff should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>ensure that the pre-screening questionnaire has been completed for each project; and,</li>
            <li>ensure that a preliminary assessment has been performed for each project requiring an environmental assessment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To fulfill this pre-screening requirement, first ask the applicant to fill out the Proponent/Organization Environmental Assessment Checklist as part of their application package. Once they complete this task, ensure that they are comfortable with the accuracy of their answers, and then review both their application and their <abbr title="environmental assessment">EA</abbr> checklist answers to assess whether their project should be subject to an EA process.</p>
            <p>If it is decided that an <abbr title="environmental assessment">EA</abbr> is required, refer to the <em>Environmental Assessment Guide</em> for further details on how to proceed. If an environmental assessment is obligatory, its completion becomes a condition for approval, as project activities cannot begin until the assessment has been completed and any mitigation measures, if applicable, identified and implemented.</p>
            <p>If an <abbr title="environmental assessment">EA</abbr> is not required, document that decision by adding the checklists to the project file. Once a determination has been made, fill out the <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> Internal Environmental Assessment Checklist [in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>].</p>
            <p>Note that EA processes can vary slightly from region to region. Please consult the regional EA coordinator for information specific to the applicable region.</p>
            <p>For complete EA guidance, please consult the <em>Environmental Assessment Guide</em>.</p>
            <h5>Partnerships</h5>
            <p><abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> programs usually encourage, or require, applicants to develop effective partnerships with those who can contribute either cash or non-cash assets to the project.</p>
            <p>When evaluating partnerships, program delivery staff should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>verify the potential roles and relationships of proposed partners – are these clearly defined in the application and budget? Will they be active participants, technical advisors or something
            else? Partnerships, for example, could indicate community support and help ensure the short- or long-term viability of a project. Partners, in turn, could originate within the private sector, a not-for profit organization, an agency, an educational or public institution;</li>
            <li>ensure that partners provide a letter stating their role and intended contribution to the project;</li>
            <li>check that partner objectives are compatible with applicant objectives, as stated in the project application, and that any benefits to the partners as a result of their involvement in the project, do not outweigh benefits to the applicant; and,</li>
            <li>review the budget to look for any indication that partners will receive remuneration as a result of project funding. In such cases, they are consultants or contractors – not partners.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The organization may also receive funding from other federal departments or levels of government. For more information on partnerships, consult the <em>Partnership Handbook</em>.</p>
            <h5>Evaluation Strategies</h5>
            <p>An evaluation strategy provides both the applicant and <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> with performance measurement indicators that can help gauge the progress and success of the project at hand.</p>
            <p>To determine if the application demonstrates how progress will be measured:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>review the proposed results measurement strategy -- does it relate directly to project objectives? Will it actually be able to verify that these have been met; and,</li>
            <li>ensure performance indicators mesh with identified project milestones.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To confirm that an evaluation method has been identified for each performance indicator:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>establish whether the type and method of evaluation has been identified for each indicator, either within the application or through follow-up consultation with the applicant; and,</li>
            <li>ascertain whether the evaluation method provides sufficient information for the Department to later calculate value for money, community impact and quantifiable results.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>6.3 Assessing the Budget</h4>
            <p>A close examination of the proposed budget, even at this early stage in the project life cycle, helps the Department promote sound financial management practices and fiscal accountability for the use of public funds. To conduct this kind of assessment, program delivery staff must, therefore, decide whether:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the budget is sufficiently detailed;</li>
            <li>projected costs are reasonable and represent actual expenditures; and,</li>
            <li>capital assets are properly identified.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following procedures can help with these determinations:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Review proposed budget costs to establish whether they fall within program- specific guidelines and fairly reflect proposed activities by:
            <ul>
            <li>checking the program terms and conditions to confirm the eligibility of proposed expenditures;</li>
            <li>weighing anticipated expenditures against proposed activities to verify if they are reasonable;</li>
            <li>analyzing how budget line items were determined; discuss these with the applicant to ensure a clear understanding of expenditures;</li>
            <li>finding out if the applicant will require advance payments; if they will and the project is recommended for funding, the applicant must supply a forecast of project expenditures; and,</li>
            <li>verifying that they demonstrate value for money.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Determine if cost breakdowns are reasonable, sufficiently detailed and accurate by:
            <ul>
            <li>reviewing the budget detail template;</li>
            <li>confirming that all expenses are clearly based on actual, documented costs; and,</li>
            <li>evaluating the appropriateness and cost effectiveness of each budget item.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ensure projected costs reflect current market value.</li>
            <li>Review anticipated expenditures against other projects with similar content and duration to determine whether the application is consistent.</li>
            <li>Examine contributions from the applicant and other sources to determine whether they are sufficient and reliable, based on written confirmation of these contributions.</li>
            <li>Substantiate the value of non-cash assets (in-kind) as contributions.</li>
            <li>Confirm that stacking limits have been respected and the stacking of assistance avoided.</li>
            <li>Determine whether the policy directive Contracting for Goods or Services by Contributions Organizations and the Use of Subcontractors applies.</li>
            <li>As required, consult a more experienced colleague or manager who may have been responsible for similar projects</li>
            <li>Confirm that proposed activities could not proceed without the Department's contribution – should this not be the case, seek justification vis-à-vis the request for funding.</li>
            <li>Include any notes indicating that proposed costs have been evaluated and that requested amounts are accurate, reasonable, and complete. in order to document the assessment process. If clarification from the applicant is required on any aspect of the budget, add the resulting notes or documentation to the project file.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: For proposed projects entered into <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> on or after December 3rd, 2012, program delivery staff should ensure that costs have been identified according to the appropriate cost categories and sub-
            categories (where applicable). Refer to the appropriate program standard cost category sets for more details.</p>
            <h5>Value for Money</h5>
            <p>When assessing value for money, the potential monetary investment required to fund project activities must be weighed against the value of the project to the community and the applicant. Economy, efficiency and effectiveness are three principles to keep in mind throughout this process.</p>
            <p>To determine whether projected expenditures are reasonable when compared to the project's expected results, review the anticipated costs to see if the applicant has demonstrated the value of the proposed activities, relative to cost categories such as the following, and document the findings in the project file:</p>
            <p>Rent:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>confirm that activities require the rental of space, and that the space is adequate for the intended use;</li>
            <li>establish whether the square footage being rented is reasonable for the project's activities;</li>
            <li>compare proposed rent costs to the going rates for a similar space in that geographic location; and,</li>
            <li>confirm that project funds are only paying for the space that is to be used for project activities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Staff Wages:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>refer to available local labour market information to corroborate that proposed project wages are set at the going rate for each position and geographic location.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other Project Costs:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>review project activities to verify whether the time being charged to the project by an administrator or executive director is reasonable and necessary; and,</li>
            <li>determine whether the costs of product development or service provision are reasonable when compared to those of other organizations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: For proposed projects entered in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> on or after December 3rd 2012 the program delivery staff should refer to the appropriate program cost category set for more details, as flat rate may be applicable.</p>
            <p>Next, determine how well the project outcomes (such as new knowledge, the application of knowledge in a new context, a new product or process, job creation) will address the need or opportunity by:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>discussing the possible impact of the lost opportunity—should the project not be undertaken—with the applicant;</li>
            <li>describing what</li>
            <li>the resulting impact would be if the project did not proceed without government funding; and,</li>
            <li>assessing the benefit of the proposed outcomes in monetary terms, should the project be successful.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The question to ask is, "Has the applicant tried to establish partnerships and find other sources of funding?", then document both the rationale used to determine the answer and the findings in the project file.</p>
            <p>It is important to keep in mind that for some programs, additional sources of funding are required – in other words, <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> may not provide 100% of the required project funds; therefore, please refer to program-specific guidelines.</p>
            <h5>In-kind Contributions</h5>
            <p>In-kind contributions are goods or services provided by the organization or other organizations/partners. They could include land, buildings, equipment, use of facilities, labour, goods and securities required to carry out projects and activities. Programs often accept in-kind contributions as part of an organization’s matching contribution. As such, the applicant will not be able to request reimbursement for these costs.</p>
            <p>If, for example, the applicant donates the use of space they own, or normally use for other purposes, to the project, and will not make a claim for payment of rent, then the amount for rent can be considered as an in-kind contribution.</p>
            <p>To be eligible as an in-kind contribution, it must be:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>essential to the project's success;</li>
            <li>eligible under the program's terms and conditions;</li>
            <li>supported by a commitment from the applicant and a valuation confirmed by a departmental official during the assessment phase;</li>
            <li>approved and documented by <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> at the initial approval or amendment phase; and,</li>
            <li>recorded in the organization’s contribution agreement at fair value; applicants' non-cash assets should only be recognized when fair value can be reasonably estimated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To confirm the value of these assets to the proposed project, assess them against objective criteria, such as prevailing consultant rates or the commercial value of rental space. Then, compare this valuation with the estimate and supporting documentation provided by the applicant. If necessary, negotiate with the applicant in good faith to overcome any difference of opinion and, ultimately, agree on the overall worth of all in- kind contributions they and their partners have offered to contribute to the project. If any doubt remains concerning the value of any asset, request an independent assessment, possibly from a regional economist or a labour market information analyst (located in Service Canada centres).</p>
            <p>Stacking of Assistance</p>
            <p>Every applicant must inform <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> of all contributions—whether of cash or in-kind— they anticipate receiving from other sources. Where the amount of a contribution made is in excess of $100,000, the guideline on the Directive of the Policy on Transfer Payments requires an end-of-project check on an organization's actual funding including total government funding received for the initiative, .This information is required in order to confirm that the applicant does not finance one set of project activities several times over using funds from various sources -- a practice known as the ‘stacking of assistance’.</p>
            <p>When performing the budget assessment, ensure that applicants supply proof of possible funding from other sources for every project they propose. This can be done as follows:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>reference and verify each additional source;</li>
            <li>ensure each funder represents a new investment specific to the project;</li>
            <li>talk to the applicant about all issues concerning other sources of revenue, requirements for repayment, and alternatives should contributors fail to deliver anticipated funds;</li>
            <li>evaluate continued project viability, should funding from any other source fall through; and,</li>
            <li>check program-specific terms and conditions to confirm whether the total government contribution to a given project is limited.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>See Chapter 8, Other Sources of Project Funding - Stacking of Assistance for further details.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 7. Risk Assessment</h3>
            </summary>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Grants are not subject to Risk Assessment, Management  and Mitigation (RAMM).</p>
            <p>Modern management of contribution programs balances  control with flexibility by adopting consistent, risk-based management  approaches, with the objective of reducing administrative requirements,  particularly where the risk is low. Risk assessment and monitoring is a  proactive approach to effectively manage, review and problem-solve any  potential issues within a project to ensure that the agreement is implemented  as approved.</p>
            <p>Every project funded by the Department comes with a  certain level of risk; there will always be circumstances and events that  cannot be predicted or controlled that could, ultimately, impact success of a  project including leading to failure. Given this reality, one must carefully  identify, assess, communicate and manage the potential risks associated with a  project in order to minimize uncertainty and maximize opportunities as it moves  through the various stages of the project life cycle.</p>
            <p>Risk refers to the effect of uncertainty on the achievement of the  objectives of a project. A risk factor refers to a specific event or  circumstance that is considered to be a likely contributor to the achievement  or non-achievement of objectives.</p>
            <h4>7.1 The Risk Assessment, Management and Mitigation (RAMM) Approach</h4>
            <p>When assessing the risk of a project, it is  understood that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>it  is impossible to completely eliminate risk altogether, but it is possible to  manage and mitigate risk by deciding what is acceptable in relation to expected  results, and then to plan accordingly;</li>
            <li>there  is always a possibility that something could go wrong, and one must consider  how serious the implications of failure might be (both for the project and the  department);</li>
            <li>measures  must be implemented to mitigate risk;</li>
            <li>projects  must be monitored to ensure that the risk elements remain under control;</li>
            <li>financial  controls must be developed and implemented to avoid the potential loss of  public funds; and</li>
            <li>the  Department agrees to share part of the risk with the recipient and other  funders and/or partners.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Risk  Assessment, Management and Mitigation (RAMM) approach is the Department  standard used to assess, manage and monitor project-related levels of risk for  all funding contribution agreements. The  RAMM tool assists program delivery staff to evaluate the project risk as well  as to develop strategies to manage and mitigate the identified risk</p>
            <p>Purpose of RAMM</p>
            <ul>
            <li>RAMM is a flexible and balanced approach which  allows the PDS to assess the risk of a project and/or to identify mitigation  strategies and monitoring  plans throughout the project life cycle as a result  of changing circumstances regarding the applicant, the project activities,  budget or results.</li>
            <li>RAMM allows PDS to identify and manage the risks of a project and take into account  previous and ongoing experience with organizations. Based on the level of risk  assessed, mitigation strategies are identified at the beginning of the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By using RAMM and sound  judgment, PDS can  determine the level  of risk and understand the risk factors that could prevent  the project from achieving success  and if required, negotiate  adjustments that will ensure the success of the project.</p>
            <h4>7.2 Risk Assessment, Management and Mitigation (RAMM) Factors</h4>
            <p>The RAMM includes ten (10) risk factors, which are  used to assess the risk level (low, medium, high) related to a particular  organization and project.</p>
            <p>The ten (10) risk factors (defined in section 7.5) are:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>project value;</li>
            <li>project duration;</li>
            <li>complexity of activities;</li>
            <li>organizational administration;</li>
            <li>stability of the board and/or  organization;</li>
            <li>ability to demonstrate  results;</li>
            <li>financial performance;</li>
            <li>activity performance;</li>
            <li>involvement of partners; and</li>
            <li>public sensitivity.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: The  Canada Summer Jobs program is subject to RAMM, however, only six (6) out of the  ten (10) risk factors are assessed. For  more information, please refer to the program specific guidelines.</p>
            <p>Although a project may have some of its risk factors assessed as  "high" this does not necessarily mean that the project will be unsuccessful or that it will not be approved for funding. The RAMM approach allows for the development of appropriate strategies to  mitigate risks by providing a comprehensive monitoring plan.</p>
            <p>The project risk score is calculated based on  the risk level selected for each individual risk factor. The project activities and financial requirements should be carefully reviewed when assessing  the ten risk factors. The definitions of each risk factor must be considered as  this will help in the determination of the accurate risk level.</p>
            <p>The risk level must  be accurate and reflect the current state of the project. Therefore, the project risk factors and  associated justifications must be reviewed on an annual basis, or whenever  issues are identified. At any time program delivery staff become aware of  changes to the project, a new risk assessment should be completed (i.e.  amendments) If any changes are made to  the risk levels or justifications, program delivery staff need to ensure the  changes are saved. If there are no changes following a review, a note to file is  still required confirming that a review was completed. Managers/Team Leaders  are responsible to ensure that a review of the risk levels and / or  justification is completed. RAMM provides the opportunity to re-assess all risk factors at a later moment or any moment during the course of the project as information becomes  available.</p>
            <p>When a re-assessment is initiated, the ten (10)  RAMM factors are pre-filled with previously assessed levels of risks and  justifications. New justification must  accompany each revised level of risk. The re-assessment may change one or more risk scores, which may also  affect one or more risk mitigation strategies: advance payment frequency,  monitoring (financial, activities, and results); and/or reporting requirements.</p>
            <p>If a change affects one or more risk mitigation strategies, the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> will generate/display a warning message informing program delivery staff that a  change of frequency for one or more of the risk mitigation strategies has  occurred. At this time, the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> cannot alter the frequency of payments and  reporting; the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> does not allow changing the payment and reporting frequency  from monthly to quarterly (or vice versa).</p>
            <h4>7.3 Use of the Risk Assessment, Management and Mitigation (RAMM) tool</h4>
            <p>A new risk based methodology derived from the RAMM  tool was introduced on December 17, 2012. The RAMM tool remains the same but  the risk scores are used in a more strategic way, enabling a more tailored  approach to managing risk, with more monitoring efforts being directed to the  highest risk areas. It allows us to  strategically implement monitoring at the onset.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> is programmed using specific formulas (a  pre-set combination of RAMM factors), to inform program delivery staff on  appropriate risk mitigation strategies, which include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>frequency  of advance payment and reporting; and</li>
            <li>frequency  of monitoring (financial, activities, and results).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This approach does not change the way program  delivery staff assess the ten (10) RAMM factors. Program delivery staff are still  required to assign a risk level and justification for each risk factor. Once the assessed level of risks have the  proper justification and are saved in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, four (4) risk scores are then  displayed in a read-only format for reference. The four risk scores refer to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Organizational  risk (uses 5 of the factors);</li>
            <li>Financial risk (uses 5 of the factors);</li>
            <li>Activity risk (uses 5 of the factors); and,</li>
            <li>Results risk (uses 5 of the factors).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each score, except for the RAMM overall score, is calculated through the  automatic separation of pre-determined combinations of five (5) key RAMM  factors; the combination of factors is different for each relating risk  (organizational, financial, activity and results).</p>

            <p>The advance payment, reporting and monitoring frequency  is automatically generated by the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> and displayed. RAMM reporting frequency does not apply for  projects which receive progress payments. Progress paying projects will  continue to report on a frequency determined by the organization&rsquo;s needs. The  frequencies generated by the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> represent the mandatory minimum number of  monitors to be performed.</p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: A claim review is no longer  considered a monitor.</p>
            <h4>7.4 RAMM Guidelines for funding agreements with other orders of government</h4>
            <p>When assessing risk, program delivery staff should consider that other orders of government (provincial, municipal) already have established internal monitoring and control mechanisms in place.  Program delivery staff should minimize the number of financial monitoring for these agreements, and focus on the verification of activities and results.  Please refer to the Monitoring and Mitigations Chapter for more details on monitoring agreements with other orders of government.</p>
            <h4>7.5 Ten (10) RAMM factors and possible mitigation strategies</h4>
            <p>When assessing the risk level for each factor,  program delivery staff must identify any strategies that could be relied upon  to help mitigate these risks.</p>
            <p>Mitigation Strategy:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Mitigation is a proactive process to identify and  determine how the management of the project can be used to reduce risk. </li>
            <li>Developing mitigation strategies encourages a  collaborative relationship with the recipient and provides increased  opportunities to identify risk and/or issues and plan appropriate mitigation  strategies to ensure success.</li>
            <li>Mitigation strategies are mandatory for all  medium&ndash;high or high risk factors. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> RAMM screen has a dialogue box where one  can put forward any number of mitigation strategies to manage identified risks.</p>
            <p>The following section provides possible mitigation strategies which can  be considered when filling in the &ldquo;mitigation boxes&rdquo;; however, program delivery  staff should not feel limited to these options as every project involves unique  risks, and mitigation approaches should be tailored to meet those risks.</p>
            <h5>1. Project Value</h5>
            <p><strong>The project value refers to the amount of the  proposed agreement at the time of the original approval (Department&rsquo;s contribution).</strong></p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> has been programmed to automatically  attribute a level of risk based on the total dollar value of the agreement.</p>
            <p>The greater the dollar value, the greater the risk.</p>

            <p>Some projects may be subject to a significant  degree of public scrutiny due to the nature of the activities or the specific  program's public profile. For such projects, the level of risk should be  assessed in terms of the potential impact that it could have on the Department  or the public.

            <h3>Chapter 8. Recommendation, Review and Approval</h3>
            </summary>
            <p><em>Referring to the 2012 Ops Guide, Chapter 7</em></p>
            <p>Immediately following application assessment, a three-step approval process begins. This is the phase in the project life cycle where <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> staff and senior managers ensure due diligence has been performed when committing public funds in support of new projects.</p>
            <p>Departmental approval involves three key steps:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>the recommendation process;</li>
            <li>review by senior management; and,</li>
            <li>funding approval.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Many applications for funding will be approved but others could be rejected at any point during these three stages, whether by the program delivery staff in charge of the file, senior managers, signing authorities in the approval chain or, very rarely, MPs, MPPs or MLAs when their concurrence is required. Most often, however, program delivery staff reject inadequate applications during the assessment, review or recommendation phases. Regardless the reason for rejection, the application must, at all times, be handled professionally with a sense of tact and diplomacy.</p>
            <h4>8.1 Recommendation</h4>
            <p>The recommendation process follows directly from the results of the assessment phase; it documents the reasons for recommending either the approval or rejection of an application, and is based upon the assessment performed by program delivery staff and, in addition, possibly on an initial review by managers. Where the assessment phase is about collecting information, the recommendation phase is about summarizing this information as a concise and accurate recommendation rationale and report based on assessment results, including consultation with colleagues, community experts, and possibly, an internal review committee.</p>
            <h5>The Recommendation Rationale and Report</h5>
            <p>Whether the project receives a positive or negative recommendation, program delivery staff must complete the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Recommendation Rationale screen. The recommendation rationale (which becomes the basis for a recommendation report) can be written using brief narrative paragraphs or bullets.</p>
            <p>Although the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Recommendation Rationale screen does not list each of the items formally indicated in the recommendation section of the Proposal Assessment, Recommendation and Approval Form, one should include enough detail to assist an official unfamiliar with the proposed project or applicant in making an informed decision relative to project acceptance or rejection.</p>
            <p>The recommendation rationale must, therefore:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>outline the reasons for approving or rejecting the application; and,</li>
            <li>provide details concerning:
            <ul>
            <li>the applicant's mandate, background and history with the Department;</li>
            <li>how well the project objectives address departmental priorities, programobjectives and guidelines;</li>
            <li>project activities;</li>
            <li>how well the applicant demonstrates the expertise and capacities required tomanage the project and achieve desired results. Do they, for example, have thenecessary staff, space and equipment? Is their plan solid and cost- effective?</li>
            <li>expected project results, such as outputs and outcomes;</li>
            <li>any other information deemed appropriate to support the recommendation andaddress program requirements; and,</li>
            <li>conditions for approval, explaining any issues raised during the assessmentphase—contributions from partners, environmental assessment follow-up, jointfunding, etc.—that must be addressed prior to, or within, the agreement (you candocument these on the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Additional Conditions screen).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the rationale is complete, print the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Recommendation Report screen for a hard copy summary of the project recommendation (pre-filled), which all authorities can then review and sign.</p>
            <p>The Recommendation Report is final upon signature of the relevant program delivery staff, reviewing authority (such as a manager) and approval authority (the Minister or delegated authority).</p>
            <h4>7.2 Review</h4>
            <p>By and large, the review phase of the approval process gives program delivery staff an opportunity to seek the advice of colleagues in reviewing their recommendation and supporting rationale. It also provides senior managers with an opportunity to focus on the details of a recommendation before confirming—or possibly, rejecting—the recommended decision.</p>
            <p>For more complex initiatives with larger budgets, many <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> transfer payment programs rely on the use of Internal Review Committees (IRC) to make balanced, objective and transparent decisions about project funding. Such committees support the delegated signing authority that ultimately approves an application by ensuring due diligence takes place when considering the field of eligible applications.</p>
            <h5>Internal Review Committees</h5>
            <p>At a certain dollar value level, or for large or complex applications (often involving technical or specialized projects), consulting an Internal Review Committee (IRC) -- whose members could include independent subject matter experts, departmental staff, other government officials and community representatives – will be required.</p>
            <p>An IRC, which brings more people into the process of assessing and recommending an application, can take one of two formats:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>For applications requesting $350,001 or more, an in-person, video or teleconferencemeeting to finalize applicant recommendations is automatically required. Documentsare distributed to review committee members in preparation for the meeting anddiscussion must also cover identified risks and the implementation of appropriate riskmanagement strategies.</li>
            <li>For applications requesting $350,000 or less, feedback and resolution typically occurwithout face-to-face meetings. As with the other format, print or electronic documentsare shared with review committee members, and discussion must also cover identified risks and the implementation of appropriate risk management strategies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The use of an IRC offers several benefits:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>greater process objectivity and transparency;</li>
            <li>a wider range of views;</li>
            <li>an increased level of community involvement;</li>
            <li>a broader mix of expertise;</li>
            <li>a solid foundation of support for program recommendations;</li>
            <li>a stronger rationale for the decisions made and conditions applied; and,</li>
            <li>more feedback available to the applicant.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While the use of IRCs may significantly benefit the assessment process, one must weigh such benefits against the investment of both human and financial (O&amp;M) resources required. Within this context, the following should be considered:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>number of reviewers necessary;</li>
            <li>range of expertise required;</li>
            <li>availability of subject matter experts;</li>
            <li>development of a standard evaluation grid or guidelines to ensure consistentevaluations among committee members;</li>
            <li>weight attributed to reviewer comments;</li>
            <li>turnaround timelines;</li>
            <li>adequacy of administrative supports; and,</li>
            <li>obligation to pay honoraria or travel expenses should committee members beinvited from outside the Department.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is a particular need to ensure ethical practices are adhered to at all times by all members. The committee, for example, should decide at the outset how to resolve any potential conflicts of interest that may arise. Privacy and confidentiality must also be maintained throughout.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the Internal Review Committee process leads to a record of decision, which then becomes a source document used to draft the funding agreement and associated schedules; it must, therefore, be placed in the project file. The record of decision, which must be signed off by the Internal Review Committee Chair, may also require subsequent Internal Review Committee meetings to address any significant issues that might arise during the project life cycle.</p>
            <p>Although external review committees also exist—for the Community Entity Model of the Homelessness Partnering Strategy; and, New Horizons for Seniors Program—the majority of review committees used by transfer payment programs are internal.</p>
            <p>Check program-specific guidelines for a more detailed understanding of the process to be followed within the particular program.</p>
            <p>For more information, including local, regional and national membership and associated roles and responsibilities, please see also the Program Operations Branch Directive on <em>Internal Review Committees</em>.</p>
            <h4>8.3 Pre-Commitment of Funds</h4>
            <p>The Project Pre-Commitment screen of the Common System for Grants and Contributions (<abbr>CSGC</abbr>) is used to submit project and financial information to the Corporate Management Systems (CMS). This information is used to set-up soft commitments to ensure that the program budget does not become over-committed while applications are awaiting approval from the Minister or the delegated authority. All programs, with the exception of Work Sharing, are required to pre-commit funds.</p>
            <p>If the agreement extends beyond the current fiscal year, the pre-commitment funding for the potential agreement must be split into the estimated amounts to be expended in each fiscal year as reflected in the forecast of project expenditures and the Manage Fiscal Year Split screen, and reflected in the CMS. Refer also to the ‘Committing Funds’ section of Chapter 8. While a project budget is always prepared for the entire duration of the project, <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> funds are always committed and accounted for on a fiscal year basis. The Manage Fiscal Year Splits screen in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> is used to allocate the total <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> contribution amount to fiscal years as well as change the existing fiscal year allocation.</p>
            <p>Please note that when a pre-commitment transaction is cancelled, the system will return the funding back to the program budget.</p>
            <h4>8.4 Approval</h4>
            <p>If the application is favourably assessed, program delivery staff prepare a recommendation that outlines the rationale for approval and any attached conditions on the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Recommendation Rationale screen. Individuals with delegated signing authority must verify and approve the recommendation in most cases; in others, Ministerial approval or the concurrence of other parties, such as MPs, MPPs or MLAs, may have to be obtained.</p>
            <p>For the majority of programs, and dependent upon the level of funding, the approval process involves the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Once the application has been assessed and recommended for funding by programdelivery staff, the Recommendation Report is printed from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> and sent forapproval to the first authorization level as indicated on the Approval/Rejection screen.</li>
            <li>The ‘Approved By’ section should be signed by the individual with delegatedsigning authority for the specified program. Please refer to the Financial DelegationInstrument for complette details related to specific programs.</li>
            <li>Each identified approval authority signs the hard copy of the RecommendationReport.</li>
            <li>When all necessary signatures have been obtained, record every decision on theCSGC Record Approval/Rejection screen.</li>
            <li>If one of the levels rejects the project or requires changes, the report is returned to theresponsible program delivery staff for the required revisions, following whichthe revised recommendation goes through the approval process again.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Applications can be approved either with or without conditions.</p>
            <p>Once approved, and the funding commitment has been verified, program delivery staff can provide the applicant with formal notification of approval (taking into account the 5- business day wait period, as outlined below). When contacting the applicant, ensure they understand that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the funding agreement must be signed before activities can begin; and,</li>
            <li>expenses incurred before the project start date will not be reimbursed, except in rareand exceptional circumstances (for example, supplies must be purchased in remotelocations before cold temperatures prevent delivery), and require approval from seniormanagement.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>5- Business Day Wait Period</h5>
            <p>Once official approval has been received and entered into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, program delivery staff are obliged to wait for a period of five business days before the organization may be contacted in order to communicate the funding decision. This time period is meant to provide the Minister’s Office with the opportunity to issue announcements, should it be wished.</p>
            <p>The operational guidance is worded as follows: </p>
            <blockquote>“Project Officers need to enter the date of approval signatures into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> within 48 hours of that approval. The 5-business day wait period will be counted from the first business day following the data entry in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>. Waivers for the 5-business day wait period are to be requested for exceptional circumstances only and made by programs through their respective ADM/EHSM office.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>The 5-business day wait period was introduced to ensure that announcement opportunities can be considered before successful applicants are contacted by any departmental officials and informed of their project being approved. This is particularly important for regionally approved files, where a daily <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> report of approved projects is produced and reviewed at National Headquarters to support announcement decisions.”</blockquote>
            <h5>Delegated Signing Authority</h5>
            <p>While approval authority is ultimately the Minister's responsibility, it is often delegated to officials at national, regional and local levels. Because this varies from program to program and according to the project value, please refer to the Financial Delegation Instrument for the program-specific delegation of authority. The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> also displays a message advising users of the appropriate minimum level of signing authority required for a specific program and confirms when the appropriate level has been secured.</p>
            <h5>Obtaining Ministerial Approval </h5>
            <p>Among the programs that do require the Minister's signature, the process may vary slightly in the execution of specific details but typically follows these steps:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Program delivery staff send the printed <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Recommendation Report to theauthorization levels indicated on the Approval/Rejection screen, including theappropriate regional/national authority, for review.</li>
            <li>The Recommendation Report is sent to the Minister's Office for signature,accompanied by the supporting rationale.</li>
            <li>The Minister signs the approval section of the Report.</li>
            <li>Program delivery staff record the approval in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Approval/Rejection screen,which, consequently, initiates the 5-business day wait period.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The responsibleofficers are required to enter the date of approval signatures into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> within48 hours of approval being granted.</p>
            <h5>Obtaining Concurrence</h5>
            <p>Some programs require concurrence from federal Members of Parliament (MPs), members of provincial parliaments or legislative assemblies (MPPs, MLAs) or others such as regional development agencies (for example, Western Economic Diversification). There is no standard concurrence form; instead, these are developed locally.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff must check for program-specific procedures but, in general, obtaining concurrence involves the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Once approved, either support staff or program delivery staff send individual projects or lists of projects to an MP's office along with the recommendation rationale for each.</li>
            <li>If the MP requests adjustments, revises or rejects a project, program delivery staff will negotiate with the applicant or the MP to obtain concurrence.</li>
            <li>In many cases, the MP indicates concurrence by signing a concurrence form; when lists of approved projects are sent, the MP may indicate concurrence by signing the entire list of projects.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When obtaining concurrence is a program requirement, projects cannot begin until this has been received.</p>
            <h5>Non-consensus</h5>
            <p>In very rare situations, a disagreement may arise between program delivery staff assessing and recommending the application, and the local MP or other party whose concurrence is required. In these cases, and if their program allows, program delivery staff may choose to note their disagreement by filing a non-consensus report that describes the reasons for the difference of opinion.</p>
            <p>To do so, the non-consensus form must be completed, signed and submitted, together with the completed <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Recommendation Report, to the manager. The manager, in turn, will take any necessary action, possibly forwarding it to more senior authorities, including – if appropriate -- to the Minister's Office, for comment and a final decision.</p>
            <h5>Approval with Conditions</h5>
            <p>When applications are recommended with conditions attached, this information should be shared with applicants as soon as possible; the earlier applicants are informed of the conditions, the more quickly they will be able to address them.</p>
            <p>Speak with applicants over the phone or in person and follow up in writing to ensure they fully understand:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the details of all required conditions;</li>
            <li>the steps they must take to address these conditions before the project can proceed, or, if applicable, clarify any conditions to be met during the course of the project;</li>
            <li>that conditions must be met, the project approved, the funds committed and the agreement signed before activities can begin; and,</li>
            <li>that expenses incurred prior to the agreement start date will not be reimbursed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Formal Notification of Approval</h5>
            <p>Once an application is formally approved, an organization must have a signed agreement in place before they can proceed with project activities funded by <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>.</p>
            <p>Applicants are informed of project approval when program delivery staff contact them by phone and follow up in writing with a letter from the Minister, MP, Department or program area. One should enter notes to file about telephone conversations in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> using the Record Approval/Rejection screen and keep a hard copy of any signed letters in the project file.</p>
            <p>Refer to program-specific guidelines and requirements for more precise direction concerning notifying applicants of project approval.</p>
            <h5>Rejection</h5>
            <p>If, however, it is felt that, after working closely with them, the application should be rejected; one should phone or meet with them in order to explain why the application will not be recommended for funding. Remember to maintain a professional demeanour at all times when saying no.</p>
            <p>During this point in the assessment or recommendation phases of the project life cycle, the applicant, upon being informed of a negative recommendation, may choose to either withdraw their application or continue with the formal process; senior managers or a review committee may later decide to reject (or, less likely, support) the application during the review or approval phases.</p>
            <p>Whatever the applicant’s choice, the reasons for recommending the rejection of an application must be documented on the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Recommendation Rationale screen.</p>
            <p>Reasons for rejection can include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the application was submitted late;</li>
            <li>the proposed project doesn't meet local, regional or national departmental planning priorities;</li>
            <li>the application does not meet the program's terms and conditions;</li>
            <li>project goals and objectives do not correspond with those of the program;</li>
            <li>the proposed budget exceeds what is allowed under program criteria;</li>
            <li>the activities cannot be completed within program time frames;</li>
            <li>the applicant has not established their capacity to carry out the project;</li>
            <li>the application is generally weak or poorly constructed;</li>
            <li>there is strong community opposition to the activities or applicant; and,</li>
            <li>a high participation rate has resulted in program funds insufficient to recommend all the application received.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Applicants not approved for funding should be informed, in writing, as soon as possible of the status of their file.</p>
            <p>Confirm whether or not a program-specific letter template exists for use when rejecting an application. In (or attached to) this letter, one must include a rationale that outlines the reasons for rejection. The Program Director, Manager or a Senior Authority, other than the program delivery staff who reviewed the application, must sign the rejection letter.</p>
            <p>Once the letter has been sent, the status of the application is to be entered into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>—including the file name and location of the rejection letter—and a copy of this correspondence added to the project file.</p>
            <h5>Saying No</h5>
            <p>Informing the applicant of a negative decision may entail a delicate conversation requiring program delivery staff to remain professional; speak with them directly, either in person or over the telephone, before sending a written letter of rejection.</p>
            <p>Consider discussing the recommendation with a colleague before speaking to an applicant as this will give one an opportunity to practice presenting the rationale for a decision.</p>
            <p>When informing an applicant that their application will not be recommended for funding, one should calmly, clearly and concisely:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>describe the process used to reach the decision;</li>
            <li>present an objective rationale for the recommendation;</li>
            <li>emphasize positive aspects of the application while indicating areas for improvement;</li>
            <li>reference information collected during the assessment phase to support the rationale;</li>
            <li>point out ways in which the application does not address departmental or program objectives -- should this be the case -- and emphasize the need for consistency in meeting these overarching criteria;</li>
            <li>mention the results of consultations with outside experts, internal managers and review committees to demonstrate that the decision was arrived at through consensus;</li>
            <li>offer alternatives, such as other programs in <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>, federal departments and agencies, other levels of government, and the private sector; and,</li>
            <li>encourage, if appropriate, the organization to submit applications in the future.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If an applicant is persistent but has submitted a application that is obviously inappropriate for funding, one should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>offer reasonable options, if any exist;</li>
            <li>clearly reiterate exactly why their application does not meet program criteria or funding priorities, and suggest alternate sources of funding; and,</li>
            <li>be clear that the decision will not change.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Do not hesitate to ask the manager or another colleague for support.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 9. The Standard Funding Agreement</h3>
            </summary>
            <p><em>Please refer to the 2012 Ops Guide, Chapter 8A</em></p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: For files created prior to December 15, 2012, refer to Chapter 8 B The Funding Agreement.</p>
            <p>At this stage of the project life cycle, program delivery staff focuses on the development of a funding agreement that sets out the provisions that will bind the parties to it. Every agreement must be consistent with the Treasury Board Policy on Transfer Payments, its associated Directive, the <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> Grants and Contributions Policy, and program-specific terms, conditions and guidelines.</p>
            <p>The Treasury Board Directive outlines minimal requirements for the following types of funding agreements:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>grants to other orders of government</li>
            <li>grants to foreign organizations</li>
            <li>grants to other organizations</li>
            <li>contributions to other orders of government</li>
            <li>contributions to foreign organizations</li>
            <li>contributions to aboriginal organizations</li>
            <li>contributions to other organizations</li>
            <li>upfront multi-year funding</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The signed agreement is evidence of the commitment made between <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> and the organization. Once signed, the terms cannot be changed without a formal amendment and the consent of all parties involved. That being said, there is some flexibility worked into most agreements to allow one or both parties to make unilateral or collaborative adjustments to certain aspects of the agreement without a formal amendment.</p>
            <p>Both the Department and the organization must comply with the provisions of the funding agreement. The Department's responsibility is usually limited to making timely payments of its funding to the organization whereas the organization has a whole array of responsibilities. These range from achieving the planned results, to managing the project soundly and ethically, to properly recognizing the Department’s financial support towards the project, to reporting to the Department on progress and results, and to, in relation to contributions, reporting on activities and expenditures.</p>
            <p>A written agreement both formalizes the commitments made between <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> and the organization and ensures accountability for the use of public funds. It also becomes the primary instrument for project monitoring and evaluation.</p>
            <p>The creation of a new funding agreement involves the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Confirming Available Funds and Applicant Interest</li>
            <li>Setting up the Agreement</li>
            <li>Committing Funds</li>
            <li>Signing the Agreement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This chapter also covers the following topics:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Delegated Authority</li>
            <li>The Agreement (or Initial) Visit</li>
            <li>Up-front Multi-year Funding</li>
            <li>Incorporating Risk Management</li>
            <li>Avoiding Employer-Employee Relationships</li>
            <li>Employment Equity Issues</li>
            <li>Revenue Generation</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>8.1 Confirming Available Funds and Applicant Interest</h4>
            <p>Once an application for funding is recommended and approved, program delivery staff must:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>if pre-commitment of funds was not completed during the recommendation andapproval phase, check with the appropriate financial officer to verify that fundsremain available to meet the commitment;</li>
            <li>at the expiry of the prescribed wait period, confirm the applicant’s interest inproceeding with the project;</li>
            <li>review again all project and organization information on file to ensure it isaccurate and up-to-date and to address any remaining concerns;</li>
            <li>obtain from the applicant, generally using the generic departmental form, adocument that identifies the organization’s authorized signatories for agreementpurposes, for cheque purposes, and, as applicable, for claim forms, forecast ofproject expenditures and activity report purposes; and,</li>
            <li>obtain specimen signatures of each of the authorized signatories identified by the applicant.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em><strong>Note</strong>: Specimen signatures will no longer be requested from organizations prior to knowing if funding would be approved. This will eliminate duplication of work for program delivery staff having to validate the signatures prior to signing the agreement and reduce the burden for organizations.</em></p>
            <p><em>At the time of agreement negotiation organizations must indicate which individuals in their organization have the legal authority to sign agreements, cheques, claim forms and reports. The Department requires a specimen of these signatures and an indication of the number and combination of signatures required for each of the various documents.</em></p>
            <p><em>At a minimum, the organization will have to provide specimen signatures of its delegates for agreement purposes at the time of agreement signing. Any missing specimen signatures must be collected by program delivery staff prior to processing of the first claim form.</em></p>
            <p><em>The Signing Officers form is a document that is required to be used to validate the officials who are being authorized to sign on behalf of an organization for agreement, cheque and claim form purposes. This form is also used to support claim payments and monitoring throughout the project life cycle and should be referenced often. To validate the officials named on the Signing Officers form, program delivery staff should do their best to verify the accuracy of what is being reported. This can be done in a variety of ways:</em></p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>Verify information listed from the organization’s website</em></li>
            <li><em>Request a current Board of Director’s listing from the organization</em></li>
            <li><em>Review the organization’s bi-laws (or other supporting documentation) that wassubmitted with the application</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>To ensure program funds are being managed appropriately, it is very important to ensure that program delivery staff verify or validate the information presented in this form prior to signing the Standard Contribution Agreement. If there is any doubt as to the accuracy of the information being submitted by an organization, it is extremely important that this be raised to the Team Leader/Manager immediately.</em></p>
            <p>Applicants may choose to sign the application and subsequent documents—such as the funding agreement—with a stamped signature, which is legally binding. If a stamped signature is used, the applicant must provide a copy of it in addition to the specimen signature.</p>
            <p>A faxed signature may also be acceptable except where existing directives or program guidelines dictate otherwise. If an application is received by fax, each page must bear the signee's initials, and the entire document must be clear and legible.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, applicants may need to provide information about their accounting practices and insurance coverage, which <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> staff might use to verify authenticity.</p>
            <p>If the applicant declines to enter into a funding agreement for any reason, program delivery staff must obtain a written confirmation of withdrawal from the applicant and place it on the file prior to closing the file. If the applicant does not comply with the request for a withdrawal notice within a reasonable timeframe (approximately 30 days), program delivery staff should prepare a letter confirming the withdrawal, have it signed by the program manager, send it to the applicant, place a copy on file, and close the file.</p>
            <p><em>Reminder: All letters (or equivalent communications) placed on the paper file should also be placed on the electronic file using the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Document Location feature.</em></p>
            <p>If the applicant agrees to move forward, program delivery staff should immediately start preparing the funding agreement.</p>
            <h4>9.2 Setting up the Agreement</h4>
            <p>The process of setting up an agreement is currently split among two phases in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, namely, the Grant Letter / Agreement Set-up phase and the Create Grant Letter / Agreement phases.</p>
            <p>As specified in the introduction to this chapter, the Treasury Board Directive on Transfer Payments identifies eight types of funding agreements. <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> primarily uses the following types of transfer payments:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>contributions to other organizations; and,</li>
            <li>grants to other organizations.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>At <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>, programs that fund simple, low materiality grants may use an application- agreement. This is essentially an application form signed by the applicant that doubles as the grant agreement once signed by <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>.</p>
            <p>Canada Summer Jobs uses a contribution application-agreement.</p>
            <h5>Standard Agreement (SA) Templates</h5>
            <p><abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> has adopted for department-wide use a standard agreement template for contributions (SCA). This template is suited to conclude agreements where funding is drawn either from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or from the Employment Insurance Account (under Part II of the Employment Insurance Act), by virtue of the Terms and Conditions of a particular program.</p>
            <p>Adoption of an SA template for grants is planned for the near future. This template will share many characteristics with the SA template for contributions. For the time being, programs use their own template.</p>
            <p>The departmental Gs and Cs training curriculum includes a Desk Aid that offers plain language versions of the SA clauses, an explanation of the SA clause numbering scheme and quick references to applicable <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> screens/functionality.</p>
            <h5>Agreement Structure</h5>
            <p>The SCA template is composed of up to five sections:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Identification of the parties to the agreement</li>
            <li>Articles of Agreement</li>
            <li>Schedule A – Project Description</li>
            <li>Schedule B – Financial Provisions</li>
            <li>Schedule C – Additional Provisions</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Identification of Parties to the Agreement</h5>
            <p>The federal government is always identified as the first party to a funding agreement. In the <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>-Service Canada-Labour context, the federal government could be one of the following three persons:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The Minister of <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr></li>
            <li>The Minister of Labour</li>
            <li>The Employment Insurance Commissioner</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These persons are formerly identified in funding agreements as being representatives of “Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada”, however, throughout the remainder of the agreement, they are simply referred to as ‘Canada’.</p>
            <p>The second party to the agreement is identified at the beginning of the agreement by its proper legal name and, following this, simply referred to as “the Recipient”. Where the organization is an unincorporated association, the corporate name of the associated persons should be reflected here and a clause added to Schedule C – Additional Provisions (see “Ad-hoc clauses”) identifying these persons by name.</p>
            <h5>Articles of Agreement</h5>
            <p>This section contains a basic set of non-financial clauses that generally apply to all projects regardless of the funding program. Of the preamble and thirty-five (35) articles, four articles only are subject to vary from one project to the next. Where applicable, these potential variations will be described below.</p>
            <p>The 35 articles are identified as follows:</p>

            </table>
            <h5>The Preamble</h5>
            <p>The articles of agreement begin with a preamble that sets out the context within which the agreement is being made and is to be understood. The context is expressed as a series of statements beginning with the word ‘Whereas’. Although the preamble does not set out any obligations for one party or the other, it is still considered as forming part of the legal agreement.</p>
            <p>The first 'Whereas' statement describes the specific program (or programs) under which the project is being funded and, thus, is subject to change from one project to the next.</p>
            <h5>Agreement</h5>
            <p>This section lists the documents that comprise the entire agreement and establishes their authority over the parties' dealings with respect to the project.</p>
            <p>This list is subject to change from one project to the next in that a number of programs do not require 'Schedule C – Additional Provisions'. When this is the case, the reference to Schedule C shall be excluded from this section.</p>
            <h5>Interpretation</h5>
            <p>To ensure that the parties to the agreement understand and interpret it in the same way, this section defines a number of terms that reoccur throughout the agreement.</p>
            <h5>Effective Date and Duration</h5>
            <p>This section sets out the date as of when the parties shall be bound by the agreement. This is to be distinguished from the project start date, which is generally a later date.</p>
            <p>This section also establishes that certain agreement provisions may still apply after the agreement has expired or has been terminated by either party; essentially, all clauses that specify a timeframe beyond the project end date still apply (e.g. 9.2; 10.1; 12.1; 13.1; 14.1; 17.1; 24.2).</p>
            <h5>Purpose</h5>
            <p>This section reiterates a statement from the preamble in order to clearly establish the purpose of the Department’s funding and, in relation to SAs for contributions, limit the organization’s use of the Department’s funding towards eligible expenditures.</p>
            <h5>Canada's Funding</h5>
            <p>This section establishes that there are, as set out in 'Schedule B', limits to the amount of funding <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> is committed to providing to the organization under the terms of the agreement.</p>
            <h5>Appropriation</h5>
            <p>This section establishes that the Department's funding is contingent upon broader funding decisions as made by Parliament.</p>
            <h5>Reduction or Termination of Funding</h5>
            <p>This section acknowledges that broader funding decisions made by Parliament, the Treasury Board or <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> could ultimately have a negative effect on the organization's project. The section gives <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> the authority to reduce its overall and fiscal year maximum funding amounts, or to terminate the agreement altogether.</p>
            <p>That being said, it also gives the organization the opportunity to discontinue the project, without any harm to its reputation, should the organization believe that the decrease in funding would make the continuation of the project unsustainable.</p>
            <p>This is the only situation in which an organization is given the authority to terminate the funding agreement without notice of default. <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>, however, could terminate an agreement for convenience's sake in order to accommodate the organization where a notice of default would be inappropriate (see Termination of Agreement).</p>
            <h5>Recipient Declarations</h5>
            <p>This section, formally known as "Declaration Regarding Outstanding Amounts Owed to the Government" and "Lobbying Act", contains two declarations made by the organization to provide <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> with assurance that the organization is in good financial standing relative to the Government of Canada and to ensure that the organization is respecting the provisions of Canada's Lobbying Act.</p>
            <p>Amounts owing in default are debts for which the organization has not yet made satisfactory repayment arrangements. They may be set off against funds made available via a new funding agreement, after the organization has been informed of this possibility as per the set-off provision within the Treasury Board Directive on Transfer Payments. Part XI, subsection 155. (1) of the Financial Administration Act, however, outlines the Minister's right to deny consent to any set-off proposed.</p>
            <p>If a set-off is applied, the appropriate federal department or agency would receive the resulting payment to offset the outstanding debt, and the organization would not be reimbursed for the resulting loss of project funds.</p>
            <p>Applications incorporate a notice to applicants informing them that they are responsible for ensuring anyone who lobbies on their behalf is registered with the Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists as pursuant to the Lobbying Act. All organizations should, therefore, understand federal policies concerning lobbying.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff must not interpret the Lobbying Act for applicants or organizations. Such requests should be directed to the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying of Canada or to the organization's own advisors.</p>
            <h5>Project Records</h5>
            <p>This section identifies three types of project records that the organization will have to preserve during the project and for a period of six years afterwards.</p>
            <h5>Canada's Right to Audit</h5>
            <p>This section does not require the organization to self-audit or to hire an external auditor at its own expense; it simply secures, for a specified period, the Department's right to audit the organization's books and records (at the Department's expense) and commits the organization to cooperate with us in any such audit.</p>
            <p>This section does not, as does the section on financial and activity monitoring, require the organization to provide us with copies and extracts (at their cost and as an eligible expenditure) of their books and records, but simply requires them to allow the Department to acquire (at the Department's cost) such copies and extracts when requested.</p>
            <h5>Financial and Activity Monitoring</h5>
            <p>This section secures for <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> the right to conduct on- and off-site monitors of project activities and expenditures throughout the project period only (i.e. inclusively between the project start and end dates).</p>
            <p><abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> may, on the basis of this clause, also conduct results monitors.</p>
            <h5>Inquiry by the Auditor General of Canada</h5>
            <p>This section establishes the Auditor General of Canada's legal right to inquire into a number of factors, with respect to an organization, under any funding agreement.</p>
            <p>This legal right stems from subsection 7.1 (1) of the Auditor General Act which limits its own application to organizations excluding the following:</p>
            <ol class="list-lower-alpha">
            <li>a Crown corporation;</li>
            <li>a departmental corporation;</li>
            <li>the government of a foreign state, a provincial government or a municipality, or anyof their agencies;</li>
            <li> a band, as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Indian Act, any member of the council or any agency of the band or an aboriginal body that is party to a self-government agreement given effect by an Act of Parliament or any of their agencies;</li>
            <li>a corporation that is controlled by a municipality or a government other than theGovernment of Canada; or,</li>
            <li>an international organization.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Hence, an organization which can be classified within one of the above-mentioned categories will not be subject to an inquiry by the Auditor General of Canada, as per the limitations specified in the Auditor General Act, should an agreement be negotiated with such an organization.</p>
            <h5>Final Report</h5>
            <p>This section sets out the organization's obligation to provide the Department with a final report for the project regardless of the program providing the funding. Some programs, such as the 'Homelessness Partnering Strategy Designated Communities', 'Aboriginal Homelessness' and 'Rural and Remote Communities' streams, require a more specific final report from organizations. When this is the case, a clause shall be included in Schedule C to this effect.</p>
            <h5>Evaluation</h5>
            <p>This section commits the organization to cooperate with <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> should the organization's project be selected for review generally as part of a formative or summative evaluation of the funding program. It also sets out the manner in which the organization will be expected to cooperate.</p>
            <h5>Contracting Procedures</h5>
            <p>This section sets out to ensure that the organization uses the Department's funding in a way that does not favour contractors on the basis of relationship.</p>
            <p>Given that there may be situations where it would be in the best interest of the project for the organization to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>issue a sole source contract;</li>
            <li>procure goods or services from a contractor with which it has a proscribedrelationship; or,</li>
            <li>hire a contractor or consultant in order to manage all, or a portion, of the project onits behalf, this section allows departmental officials to authorize such exceptions. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Authorizations under this section may only be granted by the departmental official with delegated authority to sign the agreement / minor amendment. They must be communicated to the organization in writing (an email is acceptable) and must be in respect of a written request to this effect provided by the organization to the Department and containing appropriate justification.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff must clearly document all requests and authorizations under this section in the project file.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Note</strong>: The Department must refrain from refusing to refer a candidate or pay a contribution to hire a person who meets all eligibility requirements for the sole reason that the individual is a member of the immediate family of an organization. Such action would be discriminatory on the grounds of family or marital status under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Although the Department wants to avoid any conflict of interest in the use of public funds, it also wants to avoid any discriminatory practice in the application of its nepotism policy.</em></p>
            <h5>Termination of Agreement </h5>
            <p>This section begins by listing five situations linked to the stability of the organization's performance with regard to the project that might lead <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> to terminate the funding agreement.</p>
            <p>Its clause set out financial implications related to termination of the agreement. It provides for an interim measure whereby program delivery staff may withhold any claim or advance payment for a reasonable period of time until the organization has addressed the issue.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff should generally be following the Escalation Protocol when invoking this clause.</p>
            <p>There is a second part to this section that establishes <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s right to terminate an agreement 'for convenience'. Termination due to a reduction or termination of funding is one type of termination for convenience.</p>
            <p>The 'termination for convenience' clause establishes a means for <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> to terminate an agreement when termination for default should not be considered because the organization is not in default. Usually, this will be done upon request by the organization to this effect.</p>
            <p>The final part of this section sets out to ensure that the organization protects itself against onerous cancellation costs linked to project-related contracts.</p>
            <h5>Indemnification</h5>
            <p>This section rests on the notion that Canada is a funder of the project and not an employer of, or partner to, the organization (see Relationship between the parties and non-liability of Canada). It requires the organization to protect <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> against all project-related legal action attempted by any third parties.</p>
            <h5>Insurance</h5>
            <p>This section goes hand-in-hand with the Indemnification clause. It requires the organization to purchase a general liability insurance policy in order to enable the organization to protect itself and <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> against all legal action related to the project that any third party may attempt.</p>
            <p>If a new general liability insurance policy is contracted, or an existing one is enhanced by the organization, in relation to the project, the cost of the insurance is considered an eligible cost.</p>
            <h5>Relationship between the Parties and Non-liability of Canada</h5>
            <p>This section establishes that <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> and the organization are fully independent parties; it also requires that the organization, in no way, conveys the contrary to the public, to contractors, to partners or to any other party.</p>
            <p>For more on this topic please see section 8.8 below, Avoiding Employer-Employee Relationships.</p>
            <h5>Conflict of Interest</h5>
            <p>This section specifies that the organization supports the awareness of conflict of interest policies which apply to public servants and parliamentarians.</p>
            <p>For information on policies that apply to public servants, see the Values and Ethics Code for the Public Service.</p>
            <p>For information on policies that apply to parliamentarians, see the Library of Parliament publication entitled Conflict of Interest Codes for Parliamentarians: A Long Road.</p>
            <h5>Informing Canadians of the Government of Canada's Funding</h5>
            <p>This section specifies that <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s funding of the project is appropriately recognized, that the Department has an opportunity to conduct or participate in the first public announcement of its funding, and that it has an opportunity to conduct or participate in any other public announcement related to the project.</p>
            <p>(See CoE Bulletin no. 8 for further information regarding this clause.)</p>
            <h5>Access to Information</h5>
            <p>This section informs the organization that <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> is subject to the Access to Information Act and, as such, the information it shares with the Department in relation to the project could potentially be accessed by the Canadian public.</p>
            <p>Although some materials—such as trade secrets and certain financial, scientific, business and technical information—can remain confidential under this Act, each request is dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and confidentiality cannot be guaranteed by way of the agreement.</p>
            <h5>Proactive Disclosure</h5>
            <p>This section informs the organization that in accordance with the Government of Canada's commitment to proactive disclosure of grant and contribution awards, basic information about the project could be disclosed by the Department to the Canadian public.</p>
            <p>In effect, all grants and contributions valued at $25,000 or more will be disclosed to the Canadian public via the <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> Web site.</p>
            <h5>Disposition of Capital Assets</h5>
            <p>This section specifies that the organization does not sell, destroy or, in any other way, dispose of any capital asset purchased with <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> funding until the project is over. The clause also gives program delivery staff the right to instruct the organization on how to dispose of the capital assets in a manner of the Department's choosing, the two most desirable methods of which are explicitly set out in the clause.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff must never instruct an organization to turn the title to a capital asset over to <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> for its own use or to other federal departments or agencies, including the Crown Assets Disposal Corporation.</p>
            <p>Unless it is likely that the organization will continue with similar activities following the project and another participant or another employee could use the equipment, a capital asset that is purchased specifically for a project participant or project staff member with a disability should be turned over to the individual at the end of the project.</p>
            <p>Property/leasehold improvements (i.e. alterations or renovations that significantly
            increase the performance, value or capability of a capital asset or extends its useful or economic life by more than a year) are not subject to the 'Disposition of Capital Assets' provisions of the agreement but, when incurred in order to benefit a facility offering services to a targeted community, they are generally subject to repayment provisions.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Note</strong>:The definition of 'capital assets' may vary between programs in terms of the threshold amount set out in the clause (e.g. the threshold for aboriginal programs is generally "more than $5,000" (before taxes) as opposed to "more than $1,000” (before taxes) for all other programs).</em></p>
            <p><em><strong>Also note</strong>: Some funding agreements require organizations, via a generic optional clause, to provide annual financial reports to the Department that include a detailed listing of capital assets leased or purchased by the organization with <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> funding during the period of the financial report.</em></p>
            <h5>Intellectual Property</h5>
            <p>This section identifies the organization's ownership of intellectual property and copyright for products resulting from the agreement and secures a number of rights for the Department regarding these products including:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the right to having <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s contribution properly recognized on the work;</li>
            <li>the right to securing a copy of any such work; and,</li>
            <li>the right to use the work as desired except for selling it to clientele that theorganization would otherwise sell it to.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An organization may choose to register the copyright in order to ensure greater proof and clarity regarding such ownership. The registration cost, however, would only be deemed eligible if the registration process was listed as a project activity under Schedule A of the agreement.</p>
            <h5>Notices</h5>
            <p>This section explains the manner in which the Department and the organization are to exchange notices, documents and any other information.</p>
            <h5>Dispute Resolution</h5>
            <p>This section specifies the means of resolving conflict or misunderstanding between the parties, regarding the agreement, with the intention of avoiding legal proceedings.</p>
            <h5>Assignment of the Agreement</h5>
            <p>This section explains that the organization may not transfer the benefits or obligations of the agreement to another party, in whole or in part, without <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s consent.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that when an assignment is made, the organization is not discharged of its obligations towards the Department, meaning it must monitor the third party to which the assignment is made.</p>
            <p>There is, however, one arrangement by which an organization may transfer all of its benefits and obligations under the agreement to a third party, and thus be discharged of all its obligations vis-à-vis the Department – a 'novation' is generally used when an organization:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>merges with another organization, or,</li>
            <li>is replaced due to poor health, death or other unforeseen circumstances, and,</li>
            <li>no changes to the project description, financial provisions or any additionalprovisions are being requested.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Program delivery staff should discuss potential novation situations with management prior to approval, and senior management (whether the regional Executive Head, Service Management or the NHQ program Director General) should be apprised of the circumstances, especially if the situation can be considered as 'sensitive' or 'difficult'.</p>
            <p>A novation must not be used to address difficulties relative to an agreement; instead, other options, such as amendment or termination, should be explored (see Chapter 11 'Mitigation' for further information).</p>
            <p>Steps involved in setting up a Novation Agreement:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Provide the organization with an official confirmation; both the organization's requestand <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s official response should be filed in the original and the new project files.</li>
            <li>Amend the previous agreement to change the end date and reduce the fundingneeded until the termination and subsequent close-out of the agreement.</li>
            <li>Create a new file in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> – indicate the original project number, the reason forthe novation and its start date in a note to file and complete "Relate Project" screenin <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</li>
            <li>Determine how much of the funding balance from the original agreement will beincluded in the novated agreement in order to balance the project account in theCSGC and CMS (Corporate Management System) -- then negotiate a reasonablestart date to begin the novated agreement.</li>
            <li>Prepare the appropriate form and proceed through the regular agreement process –complete enough copies of the appropriate novation agreement for each party.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Branches may have specific novation agreement forms or instructions. Those who don't may use forms EMP5364B (Novation Agreement Substituting a Party) or EMP4081B (Novation - Employment Benefits and Support Measure).</p>
            <p><em><strong>Note</strong>: If an organization undergoes a legal name change but its legal status, mission and vision remain unchanged, a novation is not required (see section 16.10.1 of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> User Guide for information on how to update the organization's legal name.)</em></p>
            <h5>Successors and Assigns</h5>
            <p>This section highlights that whether an organization should, with <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s agreement, novate the agreement to a successor or assign some or all rights and obligations in relation to the agreement to an "Assign" or "assignee", the terms of the agreement would be binding on either party.</p>
            <h5>Compliance with Laws and Applicable Law</h5>
            <p>These two sections highlight the fact that the laws and regulations found at various levels of government and governing bodies must be respected, and would supersede the agreement in cases of conflicting requirements.</p>
            <h5>Amendment</h5>
            <p>This section establishes the right of the parties to amend the agreement as well as outlining the basic principle to governing amendments -- namely, the requirement for the written, mutual consent of both parties.</p>
            <p>Signing of amendments shall be performed in accordance with guidelines for signing of the agreement.</p>
            <p>For more information on amendments, see section 11.2, General Mitigation Strategies, within chapter 11.</p>
            <h5>Unincorporated Association</h5>
            <p>An unincorporated association is a group of persons who enter into a mutual agreement (written or verbal) to pursue a common purpose. An unincorporated association does not have separate legal status.</p>
            <p>This section clarifies that the persons who sign an agreement with <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> on behalf of an unincorporated association will be held personally responsible for any organization obligations under the agreement.</p>
            <h5>Counterparts</h5>
            <p>This section establishes that the parties may accept faxed or scanned signed copies of the agreement as the original. Program delivery staff are not required to obtain from, nor provide to, the organization an original of the faxed or scanned signed copy.</p>
            <p>The section states that the faxed or scanned (signed) copy and the original (unsigned) copy "taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement." To ensure that the faxed or scanned copy is identical to the original copy, program delivery staff should verify that all pages, clauses and words are accounted for and are legible.</p>
            <h5>English Language</h5>
            <p>This section is to be included in agreements concluded in English with an organization based in the province of Quebec.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> will automatically include or exclude this clause from each agreement as required.</p>
            <h5>Schedule A – Project Description</h5>
            <p>The project description is the main component of Schedule A which includes the following elements:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Contact Information</li>
            <li>Project Duration</li>
            <li>Total Number of Participants (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Project Objectives</li>
            <li>Project Activities</li>
            <li>Expected Results</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> generates this schedule using information entered or updated during previous phases of the project life cycle (see section 6.1 of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> User Guide for further details). The schedule must be detailed enough to both indicate the organization's accountability for project results, and allow the Department to monitor project activities vis-à-vis clearly-defined expectations.</p>
            <p>Clearly written project descriptions help ensure that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>expected project outcomes are well defined;</li>
            <li>progress can be easily monitored; and,</li>
            <li>results can be measured and the project readily evaluated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em><strong>Important</strong>: The content of Schedule A must in no way repeat, reformulate, or contradict the Articles of Agreement.</em></p>
            <h5>Contact Information </h5>
            <p>Up to two contact persons for each party may be identified in the agreement. This information forms an integral part of the agreement and as such may only be changed through a formal amendment to the agreement. For approval purposes, program delivery staff are to treat this as a minor amendment and have it approved by the departmental official with delegated authority to sign the agreement / minor amendment.</p>
            <p>The organization's primary contact information is transferred into Schedule A from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> 'Primary Application Contact' field, and the secondary contact information (if applicable) is transferred into Schedule A from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> 'Secondary Application Contact' field.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> primary contact information is transferred into Schedule A from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> 'Community Relations Officer' field, and the secondary contact information is transferred into Schedule A from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> 'Administration Officer' field.</p>
            <h5>Project Duration</h5>
            <p>The project duration is the timeframe between the start and end dates of a project. This information is transferred into Schedule A from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Project Duration screen (Agreement Set-Up phase).</p>
            <p>Project duration dates have a profound impact on <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> financial elements, impacting the forecast of project expenditures, budgets, fiscal year splits, commitments, financial coding and system edits; hence, both start and end dates must be verified to ensure that all further calculations are also accurate.</p>
            <h5>Total Number of Participants (if applicable)</h5>
            <p>The information in this box of Schedule A is transferred from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Total Participants screen (Project Set-up phase).</p>
            <h5>Project Objectives </h5>
            <p>Organizations are bound to the approved project objectives for the entire duration of the funding agreement. This is rooted in the terms of Appendix B, Section 2.2 of the <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> Grants and Contributions Policy. Program delivery staff must neither change nor alter the officially approved project objectives for any reason.</p>
            <p>Care must be taken, at the Recommendation and Approval phase, to ensure that project objectives are S.M.A.R.T. (specific; measurable; attainable; relevant; and, time based) and that they are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>realistic, given individual and organizational constraints, timeframes and availableresources;</li>
            <li>consistent with program terms and conditions and departmental priorities; and,</li>
            <li>appropriate responses to identified community needs. (See RecommendationReport Guidelines for further guidance)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The project objectives are transferred into Schedule A from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Project Description screen (Agreement Set-Up phase). Program delivery staff must review this screen prior to closing the phase to ensure that the approved project objectives are accurately reflected.</p>
            <h5>Project Activities</h5>
            <p>Project activities describe what steps the organization will take to reach the project objectives and to demonstrate how expected results will be achieved. Activities must, therefore, be specific, measurable, realistic and relevant to project objectives.</p>
            <p>The list of project activities must include reasonable timeframes, milestones and means of evaluation to help determine the overall success of the project, taking into consideration the cost and duration of the project, and the capacities and constraints of the organization. Milestones are significant points during the life of the agreement. Ultimately, they make it easier for program delivery staff to monitor the progress of related activities. (See Recommendation Report Guidelines for further guidance)</p>
            <p>The project activities are transferred into Schedule A from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Project Description screen (Agreement Set-Up phase).</p>
            <p>Although project activities may be amended by the parties, the original agreement should generally reflect the approved project activities. Any changes to the approved project activities must be fully disclosed to the departmental official with delegated authority to sign the agreement / minor amendment, preferably in writing.</p>
            <p>Expected Results </p>
            <p>The federal government insists that funded project activities produce an anticipated set of results and that projects be evaluated—whether formally or informally—to measure organization levels of success or failure in achieving those results.</p>
            <p>Expected results further define and often quantify project objectives. Where expected results are difficult to quantify, this section should generally specify how the organization will demonstrate that the results have been achieved.</p>
            <p>The expected results are transferred into Schedule A from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Project Description screen (Agreement Set-Up phase).</p>
            <p>Although expected results may theoretically be amended by the parties, the original agreement should habitually reflect the approved expected results. Any changes to the approved expected results must be fully disclosed to the departmental official with delegated authority to sign the agreement / minor amendment, preferably in writing. Where it appears that the actual results will not meet the expected, it is best to document the situation and provide justification in a monitoring report or note to file and in the Close-out Summary Report in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</p>
            <p><abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> programs that fund relatively complex initiatives—such as research or demonstration projects— may require that organizations submit their project to a formal evaluation. Funding applicants must, therefore, provide an evaluation plan as part of their funding application. Their application may also include an evaluation budget to, for example, hire an independent evaluator.</p>
            <p>Schedule A must contain evaluation plan details in these cases. Such details could include descriptions of:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the evaluation methodology;</li>
            <li>data to be gathered;</li>
            <li>instruments to be used;</li>
            <li>control or comparison groups;</li>
            <li>performance indicators;</li>
            <li>implementation timeframes;</li>
            <li>milestones; and,</li>
            <li>requirements for reporting and distributing findings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some programs, however, require less complex project evaluations that may rely on the following ways to measure expected results:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>numbers or percentages, such as the number of participants expected to achievethe outcome compared to the number enrolled;</li>
            <li>an assessment of the completion, distribution and use of related products;</li>
            <li>a projection of the possible future results of intervention;</li>
            <li>participant follow-up surveys assessing participant satisfaction, length of jobplacements, retention rates, etc.; and,</li>
            <li>program delivery staff observations and overall project assessment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Schedule B – Financial Provisions</h5>
            <p>Schedule B contains standard financial provisions that the parties are bound to such as:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Maximum Funding of Canada</li>
            <li>Interest Earned on Contribution</li>
            <li>Repayment Requirements</li>
            <li>Other Sources of Funding</li>
            <li>Project Budget</li>
            <li>Budget Flexibility</li>
            <li>Conditions Governing the Eligibility of Expenditures</li>
            <li>Terms of Payment</li>
            <li>Annual Financial Reports</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Schedule B also identifies all cash and non-cash (in-kind) contributions made in support of the project by the organization and other organizations or partners, where applicable.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff use this schedule to monitor agreement expenses and recommend upward or downward amendments to the agreement if expenses change.</p>
            <h5>Maximum Contribution of Canada</h5>
            <p>This section is to be included in both grant and contribution agreements.</p>
            <p>For grants, it sets out, pursuant to the section entitled Canada's Funding in the Articles of Agreement, the maximum amount of funding <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> will contribute towards the project for its entire duration. This amount is transferred into Schedule B from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Budget screen (Create Grant Letter phase)</p>
            <p>For contributions, this section sets out, pursuant to the section entitled Canada's Funding in the Articles of Agreement, the maximum amount of funding <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> will contribute towards the project, per fiscal year, for its entire duration.</p>
            <p>These amounts are transferred into Schedule B from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Budget and Manage Fiscal Year Splits, screens (Agreement Set-Up phase). This screen will only be available before the signature of the agreement, an amendment will be required for any changes afterwards.</p>
            <p>The clause allows fiscal year budgets to be modified with the proper "authorization in writing by Canada".</p>
            <ul>
            <li>A request for such authorization should be considered as soon as it is identified thatthe amount payable by fiscal year as indicated in Article 1.2 of Schedule B will notbe fully expended.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Such authorization should never be granted for a previous fiscal year. Changes to thresholds per fiscal year for current or future fiscal years must be made by way of a formal amendment to the agreement. For the purpose of this Directive, the current fiscal year end is March 31. After giving consideration to the above-listed points, program delivery staff must take the following steps in order to provide a written authorization to exceed the maximum amount of the current fiscal year:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Clearly establish, in collaboration with the organization, the financial needs to change the current and or future fiscal year allocation (purpose and amount);</li>
            <li>Verify whether there are sufficient unencumbered funds in the program budget to increase the current fiscal year budget by the established amount;</li>
            <li>Obtain sign-off from the departmental official with delegated authority to sign the agreement / minor amendment on the proposed written communication to convey Canada's authorization to the organization;</li>
            <li>Send the approved written authorization (an email is acceptable) to the organization and, if required (see note below), adjust the fiscal year split in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><em><strong>Note</strong>: Program funds which are not spent or de-committed by the end of a fiscal year are lapsed and cannot be invested in other projects or program initiatives.</em></p>
            <h5>Interest Earned on Contribution</h5>
            <p>This section sets out to ensure that any significant amount of interest (more than $100) earned on <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s contribution is reinvested in the project.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff should encourage organizations to place advanced funds in an interest bearing account if some circumstance delays the incurrence of eligible expenditures.</p>
            <p>All organizations who receive advance payments must disclose, on their final claim form for payment, the full amount of any interest earned on Canada's contribution. If this amount exceeds $100, the organization owes the full amount to <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>. The organization may reimburse the Department with a cheque made out to the Receiver General for Canada, or program delivery staff may deduct the amount from the final payment due the organization, if applicable. If the full amount of interest earned is less than or equal to $100, the organization may keep the money.</p>
            <h5>Repayment Requirements</h5>
            <p>This section outlines a number of situations under which an organization may incur, and be required to reimburse, a debt owing to the Government of Canada under its funding agreement with <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>. For convenience and proactive disclosure, it explicitly references the relevant terms of Canada's Interest and Administrative Charges Regulations or, if the project is funded under EI Part II, the Employment Insurance Regulations.</p>
            <h5>Other Sources of Funding</h5>
            <p>This section secures for program delivery staff the authority to ensure that any program stacking limitations and mandatory leveraging requirements are respected.</p>
            <p>While potential organizations will usually be informed of any program stacking limitations and mandatory leveraging requirements at the application stage, program delivery staff may wish to inform the funding organization during the signing of the agreement, or during the initial contact, that the other sources of funding clauses will be used to enforce these requirements.</p>
            <p>Refer to program Terms and Conditions or policy documents to ascertain the stacking limit for a particular program. Appendix C of the Treasury Board Directive on Transfer Payments provides additional definitions and related factors to be taken into account when calculating total Canadian government funding for any one project. <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s Grants and Contributions Policy also provides details on the stacking of assistance.</p>
            <p>For agreements over $100,000, the organization must provide a statement at the end of the project outlining the total funding received from all sources. This will provide added assurance for the Department that the organization has complied with the terms of this section and informed the Department of any changes to its declaration regarding other sources of funding.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Note regarding in-kind contributions</strong>: In-kind contributions are goods or services provided by the other organizations/partners. They could include land, buildings, equipment, use of facilities, labour, goods and securities required to carry out projects and activities. Programs often accept non-cash assets as part of an organization's matching contribution (see Guide on In-Kind Contribution for further details).</em></p>
            <h5>Project Budget</h5>
            <p>SAs contain two new features that have been introduced in the project budget:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Other sources of funding are no longer divided per cost category. The detailedbreakdown will still be requested of funding applicants in order to enable programdelivery staff to conduct a thorough assessment of the project, but only the totalamount of cash and in-kind contributions from other sources of funding will bedisplayed in the project budget in the agreement.</li>
            <li>Budget notes are now included in the agreement following the project budget. For thepurposes of the agreement, budget notes are generic definitions of the cost categoriesused within the project budget; contrary to budget negotiation notes, they are notmeant to detail specific expenditure items.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Budget Flexibility</h5>
            <p>This section establishes that organizations may transfer funds between cost categories at their discretion. Depending upon the situation as specified in the clause, various levels of departmental permission may be required:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>With one exception (see below), transfers that increase or decrease the amountbudgeted in any cost category by no more than 10% of the original approvedlevel or formally amended level, if applicable, do not require departmental approval but must be disclosed by the organization to the Department. This could be done on an ad hoc basis or at the time of submitting the next claim form;</li>
            <li>All transfers requiring departmental approval (that don't involve a change to theproject activities or some other substantial aspect of the project) may be authorizedby the department through a minor amendment; and</li>
            <li>Any costs which were initially disallowed by the delegated authority duringapproval phase must go through a major amendment.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Despite point 1 above, all proposed transfers involving a cost category labelled with an asterisk (*), as indicated in the budget detail template, require a minor amendment.</p>
            <h5>Flat Rates</h5>
            <p><em>A number of <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> programs have up to two cost categories that may benefit from flat rates and, as such, not be subject to financial monitoring. When this is the case, program delivery staff will have the option, through the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Print Agreement screen (Agreement Set-up and Agreement phases), to include additional clauses in the agreement as sections 6.4 and 6.5 of Schedule B. These clauses describe the formula for establishing flat rates, which are contingent upon amounts budgeted for other cost categories.</em></p>
            <h5>Conditions Governing the Eligibility of Expenditures</h5>
            <p>This section identifies the conditions under which program delivery staff should disallow expenditures, and defines the appropriate use of departmental funding. This section normally contains eight items {i.e. (a) to (h)}. However, depending on the program, the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> may automatically add a small number of extra items to this list (e.g. this would apply to HPS regionally delivered streams).</p>
            <p>Two external documents are referenced under this section:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>The Travel Directive of the National Joint Council of Canada; and,</li>
            <li>The Treasury Board of Canada Directive on the Management of Expenditures onTravel, Hospitality and Conferences.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Program delivery staff should not hesitate to provide organizations with the URL's to the above documents for ease of reference.</p>
            <p>For information on goods and services tax/harmonized sales taxes rebates, program delivery staff should refer organizations to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) guide entitled RC4033 General Application for GST/HST Rebates. It is the responsibility of organizations to contact CRA in order to obtain a ruling on the GST/HST rebates to which their organization is entitled.</p>
            <p>Within a contribution agreement, <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> will only reimburse the GST/HST portion of eligible expenses that is not subject to rebate or input tax credit to the organization by the CRA. Hence, if an organization is entitled to a GST rebate from the CRA, then <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> would not be paying for the portion for which they are entitled to a rebate.</p>
            <p>There exists a difference between grants and contributions with respect to rebates. When <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> issues a grant, program delivery staff determine beforehand whether the organization is eligible for a GST/HST rebate, and then determine the approximate amount that they could claim from the CRA. For example, if an applicant, who is eligible for a 50% GST rebate, requests a grant to cover $50,000 (taxes included) worth of renovations, they would pay approximately $2,200 in GST and would be eligible to claim $1,100 from the CRA. In this case, program delivery staff would recommend the Department grant the applicant $48,900 of the $50K requested.</p>
            <p>In the context of a contribution agreement, program delivery staff may verify the books and records of an organization. This provides an opportunity to identify and recover any amounts claimed by an organization to which they were not entitled, including any tax credit or reimbursement that the organization was entitled to receive from another source such as the CRA.</p>
            <h5>Terms of Payment</h5>
            <p>This section is to be included in both grant and contribution agreements.</p>
            <p>For grants, it identifies the instalment schedule as per the data in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Manage Grant Instalments screen (Grant Letter phase).</p>
            <p>For contributions, it identifies the payment method and frequency; two options for payment method (progress and advance) and two options for payment frequency (monthly and quarterly) are available:</p>
            <h6>Method</h6>
            <ul>
            <li>progress payments</li>
            <li>progress payments</li>
            <li>advance payments</li>
            <li>advance payments</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Frequency</h6>
            <ol>
            <li>monthly</li>
            <li>quarterly</li>
            <li>monthly</li>
            <li>quarterly</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The payment method and frequency will be determined automatically based on the nature of the program and risk of the project. However, section 8.2 of the SA for contributions offers the flexibility for program delivery staff to change the payment method or frequency at any time during the life of the agreement. This authority should be viewed as a risk management and mitigation measure and should only be applied where warranted such as, for example, upon re-assessment of the risk (through the Assess Project Risk screen in the Monitoring phase), if the risk score is significantly reduced or increased.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff are required to follow the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> PLC Module - Fiscal Year End Instructions when issuing quarterly advance payments at the end of a fiscal year.</p>
            <p>Following the end of each payment period, the organization must provide a claim form to the Department. If advances are the payment method, the claim form will be comprised of three parts: Part 1 - Claim Information; Part 2 - Forecast of Project Expenditures; and
            Part 3 - Activity Report. If progress payments are the payment method, the claim form will be comprised of parts 1 (Claim Information) and 3 (Activity Report) only.</p>
            <p>Deadlines for submitting claim forms are generally within 15 days following monthly payment periods and 30 days following quarterly payment periods. However, certain programs (e.g. Youth Career Focus and Youth Skills Link) set the deadlines at thirty days for both monthly and quarterly payment periods while other programs (e.g. Homelessness Partnering Strategy regionally delivered streams that use the community entity model) set the deadlines at thirty days for monthly payment periods and forty-five days for quarterly periods. The applicable deadlines will be automatically inserted into subsection 8.4(2) of Schedule B based on pre-determined program-specific criteria (i.e. program delivery staff will not be required to, nor do they have the option to, specify these deadlines).</p>
            <p>Finally, these Terms of Payment give <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> the authority to withhold payments under certain conditions specified in section 8.5 of Schedule B to the agreement, and to retain a holdback of up to 10% of <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s maximum contribution (see chapter 9 for information about Managing the Holdback Amount). </p>
            Annual Financial Reports
            <p>This section is only included in agreements where warranted by the nature of the program (e.g. Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training Strategy). For some programs, it may be available for inclusion in Schedule B through the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Print Agreement screen (Agreement Set-up and Agreement phases); for others it may be included automatically.</p>
            <p>The clause requires the organization to provide <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> with an annual financial report. The report must usually be reviewed by an independent accredited auditor, but <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> may waive the audit requirement where appropriate relative to each annual report.</p>
            <p>Such a waiver should not be granted as a general waiver applicable to all annual financial reports, but rather should be considered separately, relative to each annual report. The departmental official with delegated authority to sign the agreement / minor amendment must agree to the waiver and, although not specified in the agreement, any such waiver should be communicated to the organization in writing within fifteen (15) days of the end of the year of the report in order to avoid the organization unnecessarily hiring an external auditor.</p>
            <h5>Carry Forward</h5>
            <p>This section is only included in contribution agreements with aboriginal organizations. It applies to agreements that span two or more fiscal years and allows the organization to carry forward unused advances from one fiscal year to the next without reducing the total <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> contribution amount.</p>
            <h5>Schedule C – Additional Provisions </h5>
            <p>Schedule C generally includes clauses addressing, as applicable depending on the program or project, the following topics:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Official Languages</li>
            <li>Environmental Protection</li>
            <li>Specific Reporting Requirements</li>
            <li>Activities Involving Redistribution of Funding Towards Sub-Projects</li>
            <li>Activities Involving the Establishment of Facility Property</li>
            <li>Activities Involving Participants</li>
            <li>Collection and Protection of Information</li>
            <li>Debt Assignment</li>
            <li>Ad-hoc clauses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The schedule may also contain ad hoc clauses, drafted for a specific situation and validated by Legal Services.</p>
            <h5>Official Languages</h5>
            <p>The Official Languages clause reflects <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s obligations to parts IV and VII of Canada's Official Languages Act (OLA). Through it, <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> effectually transfers its obligations under these parts of the OLA to the organization whose project is funded.</p>
            <p>The clause is generic and therefore may not specifically cover all aspects related to each particular project. Given the variety of possible scenarios, the Official Languages clause may be applied differently from one project to the next. As such, program delivery staff should ensure that Schedule A to the agreement includes a description of organization obligations particular to the project being funded; for example, the project description could mention that a specific service or product will be provided or available in both official languages.</p>
            <p>The Official Languages clause must be included in a grant or contribution agreement when the assessment has determined that the project should cater to members of both official language communities or provide services in both official languages (see section
            5.2 for more information).</p>
            <p>This clause does not purport to direct the organization to use a particular language of work within its organization or in its interactions with <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>, but rather to communicate with the targeted beneficiaries of the project, the general public and nearby official language minority communities, if applicable, in the language of their choosing.</p>
            <p>Unless a predetermination has been made relative to the applicability of the Official Languages clauses to all activities under a program, program delivery staff will be required to manually, in accordance with the guidelines set out above, include or exclude these clauses from Schedule C through the CSGCPrint Agreement screen (Agreement Set-up and Agreement phases).</p>
            <h5>Environmental Protection</h5>
            <p>This section establishes <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s authority to require the organization to comply with any mitigation recommended by an environmental assessment, as specified by section 5.3.4 (Ensure that Mitigation is Implemented) of the <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> Environmental Assessment Guide and Reference.</p>
            <p>The clause should generally be included in Schedule C to the agreement only if the screening process has identified a requirement to conduct an environmental assessment.</p>
            <p>Unless a predetermination has been made relative to the applicability of the Environmental Protection clauses to all activities under a program, program delivery staff will be required to manually, in accordance with the guidelines set out above, include or exclude these clauses from Schedule C through the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Print Agreement screen (Agreement Set-up and Agreement phases).</p>
            <h5>Specific Reporting Requirements</h5>
            <p>A number of programs have specific reporting requirements. For example, providing program delivery staff with annual work plans and investment plans or reports on sub- projects to which funding is redistributed.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> will automatically include relevant clauses in Schedule C, when applicable, based on the nature of the funding program or stream.</p>
            <h5>Activities Involving Redistribution of Funding in Support of Sub-Projects</h5>
            <p>Appendix G (Funding Agreement Provisions for Contributions) of the Treasury Board Directive on Transfer Payments requires departmental managers to ensure that contribution agreements address a number of issues where organizations further distribute departmental funds to third parties (i.e. an organization other than the organization).</p>
            <p>This practice is to be considered as being distinct from 'sub-contracting' (see the Contracting Procedures provision in the Articles of Agreement); the sub-contracting provision pertains to an organization contracting out all or a portion of its management and reporting responsibilities under the agreement to a third party. Redistribution of funding pertains to the organization funding third parties undertaking projects that will yield results aligned with <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> funding program objectives.</p>
            <p>Currently, only a few funding programs at <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> (e.g. Homelessness Partnering Strategy regionally delivered streams; Opportunities Fund community coordinator; Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training Strategy) allow for redistribution of funding by the organization to third parties.</p>
            <p>A generic set of clauses on this topic has been developed for automatic inclusion, by the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, in Schedule C where relevant.</p>
            <p>These clauses relate to the third party project (or 'sub-project') selection process, the content of agreements with third parties, the conditions under which the organization may itself undertake a sub-project, and sub-project monitoring and audit.</p>
            <h5>Activities Involving the Establishment of Facility Property</h5>
            <p>A number of <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> programs support projects intended to establish or enhance a facility that will offer services to persons with a particular set of needs (such as persons with disabilities or the homeless).</p>
            <p>A generic set of clauses have been developed for automatic inclusion, by the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, in Schedule C where relevant.</p>
            <p>These clauses relate to what the funding will be used for which, depending on the program, could include the purchase of land or a building or the construction, expansion, renovation or remodeling of a building. The clauses also specify what services the facility is to render and identify repayment provisions whereby the organization may be required to reimburse all or a portion of the funding provided to it by <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> if it fails to complete the work on the facility or if the facility does not render the services originally identified.</p>
            <p>These repayment provisions generally apply for up to five years beyond the completion of the project, and hence, the clauses also include monitoring provisions or a requirement for the organization to report annually on the status of the facility.</p>
            <h5>Activities Involving Participants</h5>
            <p>A number of <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s programs (e.g. Opportunities Fund, Youth Employment Strategy) fund projects that help individuals gain work experience, training or some other help related to increasing their involvement in learning, work and community.</p>
            <p>A generic set of clauses on this topic has been developed for automatic inclusion, by the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, in Schedule C where relevant.</p>
            <p>These clauses relate to participant eligibility criteria, collection and protection of participant information, and the content of agreements between the organization and participants, or between the organization and other organizations, who agree to provide paid or voluntary work experience to a participant.</p>
            <h5>Collection and Protection of Information</h5>
            <p>A number of <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s programs have a requirement in their Terms and Conditions for a personal information protection clause to be included in funding agreements.</p>
            <p>A generic set of clauses on this topic has been developed for automatic inclusion, by the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, in Schedule C where relevant.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these clauses is to reinforce the requirement that all personal information collected by the organization in carrying out the project must be handled with care.</p>
            <h5>Debt Assignment</h5>
            <p>This provision is included in Schedule C for projects involving a Community Coordinator only. The clause establishes a means for a funding organization to reduce a debt, owed to <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>, under a funding agreement by transferring to <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> the title to a debt owed to the organization by a project participant, or an employer, who was compensated by the organization under the agreement in order to provide work experience to a project participant.</p>
            <strong>Ad-hoc Clauses</strong>
            <p>On rare occasions, a project involves such particular circumstances that the standard clauses described above are not sufficient to govern these circumstances. When this is the case, program delivery staff may, in accordance with the Change Management Protocol for Standardized Agreements, include an ad-hoc clause (or set of clauses) at the end of Schedule C by adding it into the "Additional Conditions" box on the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Prepare Schedules screen (Agreement phase).</p>
            <h4>8.3 Committing Funds</h4>
            <p>Prior to preparing a funding agreement and having it signed by the Department and the applicant, program delivery staff must commit the funding amount in the Corporate Management System (<abbr>CMS</abbr>) via the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</p>
            <p>While a budget is always prepared for the entire duration of the project, if the duration spans two or more fiscal years, program funds are to be committed and accounted for on a fiscal year basis. The amount to commit per fiscal year may be identified through negotiations between the applicant and the Department, however, generally, program managers determine fiscal year splits based on the applicant's forecast of project expenditures.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Manage Fiscal Year Splits screen is used to establish or modify the negotiated fiscal year split. The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Commit Funds screen is then used to submit this information to the CMS and establish a hard commitment. Only then will program delivery staff be able to issue payments to the applicant.
            For more information on managing fiscal year splits, see Assessing the Impact of Fiscal Year End on Advance Payments in Chapter 9.</p>
            <h4>8.4 Signing the Agreement</h4>
            <p>Signatories to an agreement are presumed to have read and understood all of the agreement's terms and conditions, but the complete agreement should be reviewed with each organization, prior to signing, in order to confirm that this is indeed the case.</p>
            <p>Parties are required to sign in full the final page of each part of the agreement (i.e. the Articles of the Agreement and each Schedule). Although this should only occur on very rare occasions and with proper justification, should it be necessary to strike out a clause from the agreement, the signatories to the agreement would be required to initial the change. Agreements must be signed prior to the agreement start date in order to remain compliant with the CFO Grants and Contribution Policy. Please refer to the policy for exceptional circumstances.</p>
            <p>In accordance with <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s Grants and Contributions Policy, the organization's duly authorized representative(s) must sign the funding agreement first; the departmental official with delegated authority signs last.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Note</strong>: most organizations will allow a single representative to sign agreements on their behalf but some may require a combination of two or more to do so. In order to confirm the signing requirements, program delivery staff may request a copy of the organization's relevant by-law or statutes and place it on the project file following examination. Depending on the organization's track record with the department, this may be done prior to or following signing of the agreement by <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>.</em></p>
            <p>As described above in relation to the Counterparts clause, the agreement may be transmitted for signature by fax or email if needs be. If time is not an issue, the traditional method of signing agreements should be used. That is, two copies of the agreement are printed, the organization's duly authorized representative(s) signs them both and returns them to the program, the Department's delegated representative signs them both, then program delivery staff place one signed copy in the paper file and return the second signed copy to the organization for their own records.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Note</strong>: Where a program uses an 'application-agreement', upon submitting its application, the applicant declares it he or she has read and understood the applicant guide and the articles of agreement attached to the application form. This attestation serves as a signature to the agreement and will be validated at a later date should funding be approved.</em></p>
            <h4>8.5 Delegated Authority</h4>
            <p>There are three types of delegated authority:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Approval of Proposal / Application / Major Amendment</li>
            <li>Approval to Sign Agreement / Minor Amendment</li>
            <li>Certification (expenditure approval) authority (under Section 34 of the FAA)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As the approval authority varies from program to program, as well as by the dollar value of the proposed project, program delivery staff must check the Financial Delegation Instrument (FDI) to confirm the approval process, identify the level of departmental signing authority required for individual programs, and adhere to the interpretations provided by regional consultants for every program.</p>
            <p>All delegation of authority charts are submitted to Internal Control and Financial Policy of the Chief Financial Officer Branch (CFOB) at national headquarters for approval. The FDI for each program has been incorporated into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, which will display the appropriate level of signing authority whenever it is required (for recommendation, approval, signature of agreement, amendment, claim forms).</p>
            <h5>Approval Authority </h5>
            <p>Approval authority differs from program to program. Although it is ultimately the Minister's responsibility, approval authority is often delegated to officials at the national, regional and local levels.</p>
            <p>To ensure funding decisions are objective and follow proper controls, the person who approves a project is never the same person who prepared the recommendation. The approval and signing authorities, however, may be the same person.</p>
            <p>If consulting the Financial Delegation Instrument, note that column 'A' represents the authority to approve a recommendation for funding and a major amendment.</p>
            <h5>Signing Authority</h5>
            <p>Departmental officials with delegated signing authority can sign new agreements and minor amendments that have already been approved.</p>
            <p>Officials with delegated signing authority must first sign a Specimen Signature Card before they can officially sign an agreement, as per the delegation of authority.</p>
            <p>If consulting the Financial Delegation Instrument, note that column 'B' represents the authority to sign an agreement or a minor amendment.</p>
            <h5>Expenditure Approval Authority</h5>
            <p>Following initial verification by program delivery staff, the expenditure approval authority verifies the accuracy of a claim form and supporting materials before signing it. Their signature certifies that the expenditures comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement, as well as with section 34 of the Financial Administration Act.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: the Sunnyside Children's Group has submitted a monthly claim form for their Skills Link project that shows they made a capital purchase of $1,275 for a laptop computer; they have attached an invoice for the computer to the claim form. Program delivery staff compare the invoice to the original Skills Link agreement Schedule B and the budget negotiation notes to verify prior departmental approval of this purchase. The purchase is confirmed as being eligible; the claim form is forwarded to the expenditure approval authority for signature, and then sent on for processing and payment.</p>
            <p>If consulting the Financial Delegation Instrument, note that column 'C' represents the authority to issue funds (section 34).</p>
            <h4>8.6 The Agreement (or Initial) Visit </h4>
            <p>The initial visit with the organization is an opportunity to review agreement provisions, as well as the obligations and responsibilities of both parties.All attempts should be made to conduct this visit prior to the signing of the agreement by the parties, especially with organizations that are unfamiliar to <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>.</p>
            <p>During this visit, program delivery staff should confirm that the organization clearly understands each provision in the articles of agreement and the content of all attached schedules.</p>
            <p>As the departmental representative, one must advise the organization during this meeting that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>agreements have specific start and end dates; they cannot hold activities or incurexpenses outside of those dates;</li>
            <li>funding cannot exceed the amount specified in the agreement unless both partiessign an amendment before the end of that agreement;</li>
            <li>funding will not continue beyond the agreement end date; and,</li>
            <li>agreements are not automatically renewed; organizations must undertake a newapplication process in order to apply for any further funding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Program delivery staff should also review the following issues with the organization, as they may require further action:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Union Concurrence: If applicable, the organization must obtain the concurrence ofits union or employee associations.</li>
            <li>Permits: The organization must obtain all necessary licenses and permits, andmeet all legal requirements.</li>
            <li>Insurance: The organization must have appropriate insurance, such as third partyliability, business/commercial liability, theft, and fire.</li>
            <li>Acts and Regulations: The organization must be aware of, and in compliancewith, all applicable acts and regulations, including:
            <ul>
            <li>provincial and federal income tax;</li>
            <li>Canada/Quebec pension plan;</li>
            <li>vacation pay and minimum wage; and,</li>
            <li>Employment Insurance premiums, health insurance and workers'compensation.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Issuing T4s: At the end of the calendar year, an organization must issueT4A/Relevé 1's to all employees, showing deductions for EI, CPP/QPP andincome tax.</li>
            <li>Garnishee: If an organization is served a legal notice of garnishee of wages for aparticipant or administrative staff employee, provincial/territorial legislation must berespected.</li>
            <li>Monitoring: Establish a tentative schedule for visits and off-site monitoring with theorganization; explain the nature of monitoring and determine what supportingdocumentation will be required.</li>
            <li>Participants: If applicable, ensure participant documentation and recruitment isunderstood.</li>
            <li>Dates and Documentation: Confirm the project start date; review documentation the organization must submit to the Department.</li>
            <li>The Department's policy on Charging Interest on Receivables applies to contributions paid for by the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This meeting is also used to develop a relationship with the organization by providing them with further helpful information on claim form completion, reporting and other administrative requirements that they will need to meet during the course of the agreement. This would be an appropriate time to share the anticipated frequency of each monitoring type. Such an exchange will also encourage an organization to seek further clarification when required.</p>
            <p>Finally, this visit can be used to meet with the organization's bookkeeper or financial officer and confirm that the necessary financial record keeping system is in place. If one is unfamiliar with their accounting system, ask the financial contact to explain its organization.</p>
            <p>If appropriate, the agreement visit may be replaced by a telephone conversation. However, if working with a first-time organization, program delivery staff are encouraged to meet the organization in person as more time to review the agreement may be required.</p>
            <p>After the visit, program delivery staff must document details of the meeting—topics covered, questions asked, issues requiring follow up, etc.—in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</p>
            <h4>8.7 Incorporating Risk Management</h4>
            <p><abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> follows a flexible, organization-focused approach to risk management. Section
            6.5.7 of the Treasury Board Policy on Transfer Payments states that administrative requirements of organizations must be proportionate to the:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>risk specific to the program;</li>
            <li>value of funding in relation to administrative costs; and,</li>
            <li>risk profile of the organization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The associated Directive promotes the application of a measured response to risk throughout the project management cycle.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff should, therefore, keep previously-determined risk factors in mind while drafting the agreement, referring to <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> project file notes and checklists for details; one may need to incorporate specific provisions into the agreement in order to either reduce or control risk.</p>
            <p>The Risk Assessment, Management and Mitigation (RAMM) strategy provides more specific guidance relative to managing risk; see Chapter 6 for further details.</p>
            <h4>8.8 Avoiding Employer-Employee Relationships</h4>
            <p>Program delivery staff must ensure that an employer-employee relationship does not develop between the Department and the organizations (or their employees). The following situations should be avoided by the Department:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>direct how an organization should achieve agreement objectives;</li>
            <li>specify how an activity should be carried out;</li>
            <li>provide tools, equipment or premises for activities (although the Department may contribute to these costs through the agreement);</li>
            <li>present the project as being organized by the Department – project activities cannot, therefore, be located on federal premises; communication materials cannot present the project as being a part of departmental operations; and, agreements cannot refer to an organization performing any activity 'on behalf of the Department';</li>
            <li>invite project staff to internal departmental meetings or use them to replace departmental staff; or,</li>
            <li>entertain offers of services from organizations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Canada Revenue Agency publication RC4110(E) 1219 Employee or Self-Employed can also be consulted in order to help identify an employer-employee relationship.</p>
            <h4>8.9 Employment Equity Issues</h4>
            <p>Some programs address the needs of particular client segments such as Aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities, new Canadians and youth with barriers to employment (also known as "youth at risk").</p>
            <p>Agreements that deliver interventions targeting these and other groups must establish measurable objectives with respect to hiring or providing services for these groups.</p>
            <p>If costs are associated with serving a target group (e.g. adaptive technologies, printed materials in multiple languages), the organization must calculate eligible expenditures according to program guidelines; these must be clearly reflected in the agreement.</p>
            <h4>8.10 Revenue Generation</h4>
            <p>Non-profit organizations are encouraged, whenever feasible, to generate revenues and reduce their dependence on government funding.</p>
            <p>By definition, "revenue" generated within the non-profit sector must be reinvested, unlike within the private sector where it can be shared with investors as profit.</p>
            <p>When preparing the agreement, program delivery staff must, therefore, determine whether the project will generate revenue and if that revenue will be used to offset departmental funding (while assuring compliance with the program's Terms and Conditions). One must outline any such arrangement in the agreement schedules.</p>
            <p>If the revenue will be used to continue activities, however, program delivery staff must also document this fact in the agreement as an organization's ability to generate and retain revenue is highly desirable when a project is to continue beyond the termination of departmental funding.</p>
            <p>Should revenue be generated in an unanticipated manner – such as interest earned on an advance not immediately used – such revenue is deemed as being a part of the contribution and must, therefore, be taken into account when processing subsequent claim forms. For further details, consult section 5.14 of the Department's Grants and Contributions Policy.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 10. Activity Reporting and Payment</h3>
            </summary>
            <p>Once the funding agreement has been signed and activities are underway, the recipient will require payment for eligible expenditures associated with the project.</p>
            <p>Two authorities provide departmental, administrative and legislative guidance on issuing payments to the recipient:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The Treasury Board&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em></a> and its associated <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208"><em>Directive</em></a> provide administrative guidance to ensure sound management of, control over and accountability for all payments.</li>
            <li>The <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-4.html"><em>Financial Administration Act (FAA)</em></a> is the legislative authority under which payments are made.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The agreement and its attached schedules draw upon the guidance provided by these documents to outline the:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>type of payments;</li>
            <li>frequency of payments; and</li>
            <li>documentation required to support claims.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>10.1 Type of Payments</h4>
            <p>The Treasury Board <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525&amp;section=text#cha1"><em>Policy on Transfer Payments</em></a> and related <a title="Directive" href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208"><em>Directive</em></a> identifies the two types of payments used to deliver contribution programs:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>progress payments (or, reimbursement of actual expenses); and,</li>
            <li>advance payments.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Partial payments for grants are known as installments which may, for example, be used to pay for training and apprenticeship programs where the continuing eligibility of the recipient is a requirement.</p>
            <p>For a grant up to $250,000, programs have full discretion on whether to pay the grant in a lump sum or to pay it in installments. A grant over $250,000 is to be paid in installments unless the full amount is required in a single payment to meet the objectives of the grant. A rationale (via a note to file) for a single installment over $250,000 is required. When a grant is to be paid in installments, programs have the discretion to determine the amounts and timing of the installment payments.</p>
            <h5>Progress Payments</h5>
            <p>Progress payments&mdash;or reimbursement of actual expenses&mdash;are made <strong>after</strong> the recipient has incurred the expenses. Such payments cover the period in which the activity and expenditures have occurred, prior to completion of the entire agreement. Progress payments are available to all recipients regardless of their risk level.</p>
            <h5>Advance Payments</h5>
            <p>Advance payments provide recipients with funds <strong>before</strong> expenditures occur. Essentially, these are government-funded payments for which a recipient has not yet submitted a claim. When a recipient receives an advance payment, money is, in effect, being borrowed from the Government of Canada. It becomes money owed to the Crown and, therefore, funds are at risk.</p>
            <h4>10.2 Frequency of Payments</h4>
            <p>Payments are issued on a monthly or quarterly basis and are based upon the risk level of an organization. It is also possible to have payments based on the achievement of pre-determined milestones as described and outlined in the agreement.</p>
            <p>As per the table below, the frequency of advance payment is based upon the risk level of an organization. The risk level of five pre-determined RAMM factors (activity performance, ability to demonstrate results, financial performance, organizational administration, and stability of the board and/or organization) is automatically calculated and the overall organization score informs the advance payment frequency to be followed. The frequency of payment and reporting is automatically generated and displayed by the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</p>

            <p>Based on the overall organizational risk level, recipients with a low- to medium-score will receive advance payments on a fixed quarterly basis. Recipients with a high-risk score will receive advances on a monthly basis.</p>
            <h5>10.2.1 Fixed Quarters for Advance Paying Project:</h5>
            <p>All programs (with the exception of the Canada Summer Jobs program) are required to follow a fixed quarter schedule in all new advance payment projects. (This requirement applies to Career Focus, Skills Link and Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities as of January 1st 2016.)</p>
            <p>Given that a fiscal year is the period commencing on April 1st in one calendar year and ending on March 31st in the next calendar year, the fixed quarter schedule is:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>April 1st &ndash; June 30th (Quarter 1);</li>
            <li>July 1st &ndash; September 30th (Quarter 2);</li>
            <li>October 1st &ndash; December 31st (Quarter 3); and</li>
            <li>January 1st &ndash; March 31st (Quarter 4).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Projects not starting the first day of a quarter or not ending the last day of a quarter would still follow the fixed period schedule. For example, although a project may begin in June and end the following January, its quarters would still follow the fixed period schedule and certain periods would simply be shorter. For this example, the project first quarter would only include June expenditures and activities, while its last quarter would only include January expenditures and activities.</p>
            <h4>10.3 Documentation Required to Process Payments</h4>
            <p>To request the payment of expenses eligible for reimbursement under a funding agreement or to reconcile actual expenses against advance payments, recipients must submit a claim, including an activity report and other supporting documentation as required for the period covered that demonstrates recipient progress towards achieving objectives &ndash; through the completion of activities and the realization of expected results - as described in the funding agreement. Activity reports are mandatory and must be attached to the claim.</p>
            <p>A forecast of project expenditures (FPE) is mandatory for advance payments. The FPE supports cash management and fiscal year splits for the project.</p>
            <p>FPEs are optional for progress payments. However, some programs require an FPE for all projects in order to support cash management and fiscal year splits. Consult the program specific guidelines in order to determine whether an FPE is required.</p>
            <p>Supporting documentation is determined by the implementation of a risk-based approach. The Department uses the organizational risk level in a strategic way, enabling a tailored approach to managing the risk, with more efforts directed to the higher risk projects.</p>
            <p>The requirement of supporting documentation for processing a claim is based on the total score of five (5) criteria for &ldquo;organizational risk&rdquo; determined for the project: activity performance, ability to demonstrate results, financial performance, organization administration, and stability of the board and/or organization. Projects with a medium and high organizational risk score have to submit a GL or financial spreadsheet along with the claim. The submission of a GL or financial spreadsheet is to assist the program delivery staff in their selection of transactions within higher risk cost categories for the purpose of processing the claim. It may also be used for a financial monitor. The following table illustrates what supporting documentation is required based on the RAMM score for the organizational risk:</p>
            <table class=" width-90 align-left ">

            </table>
            <p>Please note that any claim over $500,000, regardless of their risk level (with the exception of agreements with provincial and territorial governments) will be treated as high risk, due to their high dollar value, and will be subject to the submission of supporting documentation.</p>
            <p>As of December 17th, 2012, all programs (with the exception of Canada Summer Jobs) will be required to use the following standard documents for all new projects:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the claim (based on program cost category set); </li>
            <li>the activity report; and</li>
            <li>the FPE (if on advance payment).</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>10.3.1 Claim Information</h5>
            <p>Project recipients complete their own tombstone data. They also enter the actual expenses incurred under each relevant, eligible cost category listed on the form. A zero should be recorded if no expenses were incurred within a certain cost category.</p>
            <h5>10.3.2 Activity Report</h5>
            <p>In addition to the claim, project recipients submit an activity report. Specific timing for reporting is outlined in the funding agreement.</p>
            <p>Project recipients use the activity report to demonstrate how the funding received is used to support their project objectives.</p>
            <p>The activity report summarizes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the overall progress achieved toward the objectives;</li>
            <li>activities carried out to achieve the outcomes; and,</li>
            <li>possible issues which could affect the success of the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: the activity report is not intended to show every detail of the project. It should be used as a systematic summary of key information about the project. For more information, please consult the <em>How To Activity Report</em> tools.</p>
            <h5>10.3.3 Forecast of Project Expenditures</h5>
            <p>All contribution projects (with the exception of the Canada Summer Jobs program) that use an advance payment frequency must include a forecast of project expenditures (FPE) in order to support cash management and fiscal year splits.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the FPE is to plan and outline the anticipated financial requirements of a project as well as when those funds are required. It includes the expected amount of funding required for each future reporting period and actual amounts spent and/or approved for past periods.</p>
            <p>Recipients complete the FPE to identify expected expenditures for their project, taking into account:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the project&rsquo;s financial need (how much money is needed);</li>
            <li>timing (when they need it); and,</li>
            <li>the project&rsquo;s current financial.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Recipients may either submit their FPE electronically via the Grants and Contributions Online Services (<abbr>GCOS</abbr>), electronically or in paper format.</p>
            <p>When updating the FPE paper form, recipients should enter the actual amounts of expenditures approved by the Department in past periods, regardless of the amount they have claimed to date. Requests for remaining periods should reflect the estimated amounts required to complete project activities and achieve expected results. The total of all such past and future periods, however, cannot exceed the total agreement value.</p>
            <p>In order to ensure sound financial management of project and program budgets, the forecast of project expenditures should be reviewed on an ongoing basis to determine if the annual budget will be fully expended. At a minimum this should be reviewed in the last quarter of the fiscal year. If it is determined that the recipient will not utilize its current fiscal year budget, these funds should be de-committed from the project prior to period 13 (prior to March 31). The de-commitment of funds may be used to meet other fiscal year priorities, or will be lapsed. In the case of multi-year agreements, the unused commitment may be moved over to the next fiscal year using new year budget and should be based on financial need and budget availability. This must be completed prior to period 13 (prior to March 31). A minor amendment is always required to complete these adjustments (please refer the Monitoring and Mitigation Strategies Chapter for additional information).</p>
            <h4>10.4 Steps in Processing Payments</h4>
            <p>Whether a recipient is receiving progress or advance payments, the steps in processing payments are the same:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Step 1: receiving and reviewing the claim;</li>
            <li>Step 2: verifying the account;</li>
            <li>Step 3: obtaining payment approval; and</li>
            <li>Step 4: requisitioning a payment (if applicable).</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Step 1: Receiving and Reviewing the Claim</h5>
            <p>The recipient submits a claim (by email, via <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr> or in paper format) accompanied by an activity report, and if applicable, an FPE and other supporting documents on a monthly or quarterly basis. If program-specific guidelines allow, project recipient can fax their claims, but they must be clear and legible.</p>
            <p>Given the slight variations in claims (three standard forms), program delivery staff must ensure that project recipients are provided with, and submit, the applicable claim containing the proper cost categories.</p>
            <p>Once the claim from the recipient has been received, program delivery staff should review it carefully to determine whether:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the project recipient has completed the claim properly;</li>
            <li>the claim is consistent with the frequency of payments prescribed within the funding agreement;</li>
            <li>supporting documentation is submitted (if applicable); </li>
            <li>eligible expenditures incurred correspond to approved activities and have been entered into the correct cost categories, and the cost categories are in agreement with the program-specific cost category set;</li>
            <li>amounts claimed for each eligible expenditure category meet the terms and rates defined within the agreement (generally schedule B);</li>
            <li>the expenditures were incurred within the approved timeframe;</li>
            <li>the claim reflects actual project costs;</li>
            <li>the sum of all payments made does not exceed the total amount allowable under the agreement;</li>
            <li>the project recipient is meeting the agreement provisions;</li>
            <li>the latest monitoring report supports the issuance of further payments; and</li>
            <li>the claim was signed by the delegated representatives of the organization, as identified in the Signing Officers form.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: If the claim has not been completed proprely, program delivery staff must ask the recipient to re-sumbmit a corrected claim, or ask the recipient to initial the corrections made by the program delivery staff.</p>
            <p>Following receipt of the claim, begin by capturing claim information in the Financial Management phase of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Project Life Cycle module using the <em>Capture Claim Information screen. </em> The <em>Financial Management</em> Chapter of the <em><abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> User Guide</em> describes the screens and processes which should be used in order to enter and reconcile claims.</p>
            <h5>Step 2: Verifying the Account</h5>
            <p>Program delivery staff is expected to review the activity report to ensure the activities are in line with the claimed expenses.</p>
            <p>Once the claim and activity report have been received and reviewed (as detailed above), the program delivery staff will request supporting documentation (for example invoices, receipts or other supporting documentation as determined by the Department to support expenditures claimed). All reviews should be documented and saved in the supporting documents function within <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>. The note should include a confirmation of the outcome (i.e. that all documents reviewed were satisfactory and accounted for the required minimum percentage, or that additional information is required to substantiate the claimed amount).</p>
            <p><strong>Selecting transaction level information (only applicable for medium and high risk)</strong></p>
            <p>The submission of a GL or financial spreadsheet is to assist the program delivery staff in their selection of transactions within higher risk cost categories for the purpose of processing the claim, and may be used during a financial monitor. A minimum percentage of the total claimed expenditures (5% for medium and 10% for high risk projects) from higher risk cost categories will be reviewed.</p>
            <p>Medium organizational risk level</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Program delivery staff request a sampling of receipts selected from transactions in the General Ledger (GL) or a financial spreadsheet only <strong>for the first two reporting periods, if no issues are identified</strong>. If there are issues identified with the first two claims, program delivery staff will continue to request supporting documentation until there are two claim periods without any discrepancies or issues. If issues persist, or if the project is of a short duration, program delivery staff should schedule a financial monitoring to address the issue(s). The transactions for review are to be taken from the higher risk cost categories as defined below. Program delivery staff will request supporting documentation (for example receipts, invoices, or other supporting documentation as determined by the Department from the higher risk cost categories to substantiate a minimum of 5% the amount claimed under those higher risk cost categories).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to note that payment will not be withheld while waiting for the supporting documents. Should issues be identified with the receipts in the post-payment verification phase, the amount can be disallowed on subsequent payments. However, the observation should be documented for future reference.</p>
            <p>High organizational risk level</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Program delivery staff requests a sampling of receipts selected from transactions in the GL or financial spreadsheet for <strong>all reporting periods</strong>. These transactions are to be taken from the higher risk cost categories defined below. Program delivery staff will request supporting documentation (for example, receipts, invoices or other supporting documentation as determined by the Departmentfrom the higher risk cost categories to substantiate a minimum of 10% of the amount claimed under those higher risk cost categories. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to note that payment is withheld until receipts are received. Should issues be identified with the receipts in the pre-payment verification phase, the amount is disallowed from the claim.</p>
            <p>Higher risk cost categories include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Individual cost categories with a total amount in excess of 50% of total value of the claim (e.g. total claim is $100,000, and a specific cost category represents $65,000)</li>
            <li>Other categories such as:
            <ul>
            <li>Capital costs / Capital assets; </li>
            <li>Project costs (including Hospitality and Travel &ndash; if applicable in cost set); and </li>
            <li>Travel (applicable to Set A with Flat Rates projects) </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that higher risk cost categories may vary from program to program as well as from project to project. The following additional cost categories have been identified for ASETS, SPF and HPS agreements (where applicable):</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Sub-projects Administrative costs</li>
            <li>Child Care costs</li>
            <li>Sub-projects Project costs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other cost categories</p>
            <p>If the minimum amount to review has not been achieved by sampling the above mentioned higher risk cost categories, program delivery staff may request a percentage of receipts and/or invoices from the remaining cost categories</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Administrative costs (with the exception of programs using flat rates) </li>
            <li>Wages </li>
            <li>Rent (Set A for Opportunities Fund and Skills Link only) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other Considerations</p>
            <p>As the claim is supported by an activity report, program delivery staff should select sample invoices and/or receipts based on activities that occurred during the reported period. For example, should the activity report identify a trip and/or a conference, it is suggested that the program delivery staff request invoices and receipts to substantiate that particular expenditure. It is also recommended that the sample of cost categories vary from the two reporting periods. For example, if wages are sampled during the first reporting period, it is recommended that a different cost category be sampled during the second reporting period.</p>
            <p>For short term medium risk projects (less than 6 months)</p>
            <p>As previously stated in the Risk Assessment Chapter, medium risk projects have a quarterly reporting frequency. According to the supporting documentation requirements, medium risk projects must submit a general ledger or financial spreadsheet for the first two reporting period. In addition, the project is subject to one financial monitoring during the life of the agreement.</p>
            <h5>Step 3: Obtaining Payment Approval</h5>
            <p>After the claim has been received, checked and verified, program delivery staff can obtain approval for that claim. Under section 34 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-4.html"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a>, the expenditure approval authority must review the claim and supporting documents, if applicable; to confirm the verification process was adequate.</p>
            <p>In <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, after entering the claim information, program delivery staff will see a claim approval screen. This approval screen includes a summary of the submitted information as well as a signature section which is to be printed and sent for the necessary internal approval of section 34. To ensure that the correct delegation of authority is applied, program delivery staff should verify the Signing Authority Web Application (SAA) as this central system provides electronic access to the Delegated Authorities and facilitates the maintenance of the departmental specimen signature cards. When the project recipient submits a paper claim, the claim approval form is to be printed from the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> and attached to the paper submission before being sent for section 34 approval.</p>
            <p>As part of their management control function, Cost Centre (CC) managers (or whoever oversees budgets) have primary responsibility for costs incurred and expenditures charged to their budgets. They must, therefore, perform expenditure pre-audit prior to transaction release in order to verify that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>claims submitted for payment are originals or copies;</li>
            <li>the signature of the expenditure approval authority officer appears on the payment document. Initials are required in the &lsquo;Pre-audit performed by&rsquo; section of the claim or advance and activity report for project entered in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> prior to December 17th, 2012); and,</li>
            <li>the name, address and project number that appear in SAP correspond to those in the project file.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Do not exceed the limits of delegated authority; refer to the <em>Financial </em><a title="Delegation of Authority Instrument" href="http://iservice.prv/eng/finance/DELEG/deleg-toc.shtml"><em>Delegation Instrument</em> to confirm</a> expenditure approval authority.<br />
            The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr><em>Authorize Transaction</em> screen allows program delivery staff to record the payment approval (or rejection).</p>
            <p>Note that in the rare case where a claim for $0 is submitted, a section 34 certification is not required as no payment is being issued.</p>
            <p><strong>Capture Claim Screen</strong></p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> <em>Capture Claim Information</em><em> screen is used to:</em></p>
            <ul>
            <li>record the details of expenditures claimed by the organization; and,</li>
            <li>change and re-submit claim rejected during the first review stage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>See the <em>Financial Management</em> Chapter of the <em><abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Users Guide</em> for more information about the processes followed to capture and reconcile claim data.</p>
            <h5>Step 4: Requisitioning a Payment</h5>
            <p>The Department issues a payment once the claim and supporting documentation is verified and approved.</p>
            <p>Once a claim has been approved, program delivery staff have no further duties to perform where requisitioning the payment is concerned. Once approved, the claim is entered into SAP, which then automatically informs Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) of the request for payment. PSPC then issues and sends the payment to the organization. Please ensure the organization&rsquo;s e-mail is on file. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the recipient when the payment has been issued.</p>
            <p>Please note that effective April 1, 2015, amendments to the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> were implemented to streamline low value payments. Payments of $2.00 or less will no longer be paid out or collected.</p>
            <h4>10.5 Issuing Advance Payments</h4>
            <p>Under section 34 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-4.html"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a>, program delivery staff must ensure the following conditions are met before authorizing advance payments:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the funding agreement specifies that advance payments are a permitted payment option;</li>
            <li>the recipient has identified their need for advance payments and provided a rationale&mdash;including a forecast of project expenditures (FPE); and</li>
            <li>advance payment amounts will be limited to the recipient&rsquo;s imminent cash requirements, based on the FPE and project activities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Program delivery staff must exercise prudence in making advance payments and must have sufficient basis for issuing all payments to a recipient.</p>
            <p>Advance payments may include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>initial advance payment;</li>
            <li>subsequent advance payments; and,</li>
            <li>final payment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>10.5.1 Initial Advance Payment</h5>
            <p>Subject to the terms of the funding agreement identified during the Agreement Set-up phase, program delivery staff can issue the first, or initial advance payment (which may account for up to two periods) based on the recipient&rsquo;s needs, as identified on their forecast of project expenditures (FPE) to help the recipient pay for eligible expenses that must be incurred at the beginning of project activities.</p>
            <p>This advance represents the first period on the FPE depending on the frequency of the advance i.e. monthly or quarterly. The actual amount of an advance is based upon the FPE and can only be issued after the funding agreement is signed by both parties.</p>
            <p>For further information concerning the issuance of initial advance payments, please consult the section <em>Prepare Initial Advance</em><em>,</em> of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> User Guide.</p>
            <p>Note: While reviewing the following information, you may also wish to consult the <em>Financial Management Chapter </em>of the <em><abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Users Guide</em>, which describes the screens and processes used to issue advances.</p>
            <h5>10.5.2 Subsequent Advance Payment</h5>
            <p>Any advance payment issued after the initial advance is referred to a subsequent advance.</p>
            <p>All advance payments are tied to the FPE and should not be issued any earlier than necessary. This FPE is mandatory for all projects using advance payments.</p>
            <p>Before issuing advance payments, program delivery staff must carefully assess the recipient&rsquo;s FPE against corresponding project activities approved in the funding agreement to determine the appropriate advance payment amount. If the FPE does not appear realistic, one should discuss issues of concern with the recipient and request an updated version.</p>
            <p>Two consecutive advance payments may be issued prior to receiving a recipient&rsquo;s claim, however, a third advance payment cannot be issued until a claim is received and reconciled for the first advanced period.</p>
            <p>The total of these payments cannot exceed the amount indicated in the FPE for that period. If the FPE is amended by the recipient for previously paid out periods, an adjustment payment can be processed.</p>
            <p>Recipients claim eligible expenditures using the departmental standardized forms: claim, FPE, activity report and supporting documentation (if applicable).</p>
            <p>Once program delivery staff receives and processes claims, subsequent advances should be issued based on a detailed review of these claims and supporting documentation. Note that, although variations may exist between programs, generally it is expected that claims are submitted to the Department within 15 days following the reporting period (refer to section 10.10 &ndash; Service Standards). Refer to section 10.4 for information on how to process a claim.</p>
            <p>Determining the amount of the subsequent advance payments involves several steps: reconciling the amount that has been claimed by the recipient against the amount that was advanced to them and then, issuing the subsequent advance.</p>
            <p>Steps to determine subsequent advance:</p>
            <p>Reconciling the claim</p>
            <ul>
            <li>[<em>Amount claimed for period 1</em>] &ndash; [<em>Period 1 advance</em>] = amount to be paid</li>
            <li>If the claim is greater than the amount of the advance for the period, <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> will generate a claim payment for the difference.</li>
            <li>Once the claim payment is approved in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, you can prepare the next subsequent advance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Issuing the subsequent advance</p>
            <p>There are three possible outcomes when reconciling a claim.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The claim is equal to the advance: No payment issued</li>
            <li>The claim is greater than the advance: A claim payment is issued</li>
            <li>The claim is less than the advance: The balance goes into the unaccounted funds.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>The recipient forecasted $10,000 for the month of September, which was issued as an advance payment on August 20th.</p>
            <p>On September 1st, the recipient submitted a revised FPE in which $15,000 was forecasted for September.</p>
            <p>On September 3rd, program delivery staff confirmed that the increased advance aligned with the project activities for September, adjusted the FPE in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, and recommended the issuance of an additional payment of $5,000 for September.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>An advance payment of $10,000 was issued to the recipient for the month of May. On June 15th, the recipient claimed $8,000 in eligible expenses for that month.</p>
            <p>The FPE for June shows $10,000. The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> will automatically assume that the unclaimed balance of $2,000 will be carried over to the next month.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, therefore, will permit a maximum advance of $8,000 for June.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Although it is an acceptable practice to issue two consecutive advance payments prior to receiving a claim, the Department cannot issue a third advance payment until a claim for the first period is received and processed. The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> prevents any further advance payments from being issued until at least one of the advance payments has been reconciled against a claim for actual expenses incurred.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>$10,000 in advance payments was issued to the recipient for each of the months of May and June for a total of $20,000. There are now two outstanding advance payments issued to the recipient and no claim has been submitted to date. The recipient&rsquo;s forecast of project expenditures for July is also $10,000.</p>
            <p>On June 15th, program delivery staff receives a claim for $6,000 of eligible expenses for the month of May. This claim is processed. Now one advance payment has been reconciled with $4,000 carried over ($10,000 issued less $6,000 claimed). One advance payment is still outstanding for $10,000 for June.</p>
            <p>In June, program delivery staff can still issue an advance payment for July up to the maximum of $6,000 ($10,000 required for July less $4,000 balance from May). Again, the recipient will have two outstanding advances: one for June of $10,000 and one for July of $6,000. The claim for costs incurred in June must be processed before any further funds can be advanced.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Program delivery staff cannot issue an advance retroactively; one has until the last day of a period (monthly or quarterly) to issue advances for that period.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <p>If the project is on a monthly reporting schedule, April 30th is the last day that an advance payment can be issued for the month covering April 1st to 30th.</p>
            <p>If the project is on a quarterly reporting schedule, June 30th is the last day that an advance payment can be issued for the quarter covering April 1st to June 30th.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Program delivery staff cannot issue an advance for a period when the subsequent period has already been advanced.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>On August 10th, program delivery staff issued an advance payment of $10,000 for September as per the recipient&rsquo;s FPE. On August 29th, program delivery staff issued an advance payment of $10,000 for October as per the recipient&rsquo;s FPE.</p>
            <p>On September 3rd, program delivery staff receives a revised FPE from the recipient that shows a need for an additional $3,000 in September.</p>
            <p>However, the October advance payment has already been issued, so no further advances can be made for September. Program delivery staff would have to negotiate with the recipient one of the following options:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Adjust the October FPE to make up for the $3,000 shortfall and issue a second advance for October (with this option, watch that <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> does not issue a separate payment for any shortfall registered for September despite the second advance for October).</li>
            <li>Alternatively, the recipient may submit a claim for September for the actual expenses. If the total for September is $12,595, then the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> will issue a separate payment to the recipient for $2,595 ($10,000 less $12,595 = negative balance of $2,595)</li>
            </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <h5>10.5.3 Final Payment</h5>
            <p>If the claim is the last one of the project, please refer to the Close-Out &ndash; Making Final Payments Chapter.</p>
            <h5>10.5.4 Interest Earned on Advance Payments</h5>
            <p>Interest earned on advance payments is deemed to be part payment of Canada&rsquo;s contribution. Recipients must, therefore, account for any interest earned in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) on advance payments. The interest will be taken into account in the calculation of the final payment by Canada, or repayment by the Recipient.</p>
            <h5>10.5.5 Managing the Holdback Amount</h5>
            <p>The Department may hold back a portion of the allocated funds until project completion in order to minimize the risk of overpayment and to encourage the recipient to comply with agreement provisions. Holdbacks apply to funding agreements using advance payments.</p>
            <p>To avoid the possibility of overpayment, program delivery staff should not pay the full funding amount available under the agreement as an advance. The retained holdback should only be paid after the recipient has submitted their final claim and other supporting documentation as required by Canada.</p>
            <p>Up to a maximum of 10% of the total funding amount can be held back. The general rule is to hold back 10% of the total funding amount; however, program delivery staff do have the option, upon request, of reducing the holdback amount. To do this, one must ask the recipient for a letter (which can be emailed, faxed or uploaded to the <abbr title="Grants and Contributions Online Services ">GCOS</abbr>) that requests the reduction and provides a rationale for granting it. Program delivery staff, in turn, must document the request, providing a recommendation and, if affirmative, include a rationale in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> for the reduced holdback. Some programs have other specific guidelines and therefore program delivery staff should, if applicable, refer to those guidelines.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p>A contribution agreement was signed with a recipient.&nbsp; The agreement value is $250,000, and a holdback was established at $25,000 ($250,000 x 10%), thus leaving $225,000 available to advance funds.</p>
            <p>If you had an agreement with a total value of $270,000, and the holdback is 10%, the total holdback would be $27,000.</p>
            <p>If the money was needed before the final claim and monitoring was completed, the holdback could be reduced to a lower amount, as low as zero.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Prior to reducing the holdback amount, the recipient must request in writing that the holdback amount be reduced, and provide a description and rationale for the use of all the funds held in the holdback. You must approve this rationale and document in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</p>
            <p>If, by the end of a project, the total payments made to the recipient exceed the allowable expenses, the difference&mdash;an overpayment&mdash;becomes a debt to the Crown. This outstanding balance must be recorded as an account receivable transaction in the Departmental Accounts Receivable System (DARS). It will then be recovered from the recipient.</p>
            <p>Whenever a recipient fails to provide adequate accounting, or has not used departmental funds for authorized purposes, a demand for accounting or repayment can be issued under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-4.html"><em>Financial Administration Act</em></a><em> (04-01) Section 76(1)(b) and (c).</em></p>
            <p>Please refer to the <em>Overpayments</em> section of the Close-Out Chapter for additional information.</p>
            <p>One may also wish to consult the <em>section 9.2 Agreement / Create Grant Agreement Chapter </em>of the <em><abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> User Guide</em>, which describes the screens and processes used to establish holdbacks.</p>
            <h3>10.6 Carry-forwards of Unused Commitments</h3>
            <p>Carry forward is defined as the act of transferring the balance of an unused commitment from one fiscal year to the following fiscal year. The <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525"><em>Treasury Board Policy on Transfer Payments</em></a> and its associated <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14208"><em>Directives</em></a> dictates if and how a carry forward is allowed for contribution programs.</p>
            <p>The automatic transfer of unused commitment from one year to next year&rsquo;s budget is not an acceptable practice unless otherwise authorized in writing by Canada in the form of an amendment to the agreement (Schedule B of the contribution agreement, clause 1.2).</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff are encouraged to follow the principles of the financial management policies regarding commitment controls and to de-commit unused funds as soon as they are identified. Upon receipt of a carry forward request, a review of the organization&rsquo;s financial track record and project activities for the previous and upcoming fiscal years should be conducted by program delivery staff to determine if the request is reasonable and gauge the organization&rsquo;s ability to expend, in the upcoming fiscal year, both the planned carry forward commitment as well as their annual allocation for that fiscal year.</p>
            <p>The Department&rsquo;s decision to approve the carry forward request must be documented via an amendment and if approved, an amended agreement will be required in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> to reallocate the funds accordingly. Please refer to the <em>Monitoring and Mitigation Chapter</em> for additional information.</p>
            <h5>10.6.1 Assessing the Impact of Fiscal Year End on Advance Payments</h5>
            <p>Generally, program delivery staff cannot issue advance payments to recipients in one fiscal year when the related expenditures will likely not be incurred until the following fiscal year.</p>
            <p>Approved funds must be spent in the fiscal year for which they are appropriated and must not be carried forward by means of advance payments.</p>
            <p>One must, therefore, issue advance payments required for the new fiscal year as of April 1st and charge these to an appropriation in the new year; remember to consider outstanding advances from the previous fiscal year when issuing further advances or claim payments in the new fiscal year. Also, advise recipients that fiscal year-end requirements prevent program delivery staff from issuing monthly or quarterly advances in April as quickly as other advances may have been issued.</p>
            <p>Exceptions, however, may be made to this fiscal year rule if they are necessary to meet program objectives. Such exceptions must be well documented and monitored to ensure advanced funds are properly accounted for.</p>
            <p>In such cases, program delivery staff can only issue an advance for the month of April from old year funds. One must do this before March 31st to count it as eligible for payment from the old fiscal year; after that, issue the advance from new fiscal year funds. Each February, Fiscal Year End Instructions are posted on the CoE Website and provide information on dealing with year-end processes.</p>
            <p>In situations where an agreement extends beyond one fiscal year and an advance is provided in the first fiscal year, but a portion of that advance has not yet been used by the recipients by the end of that fiscal year, the Department may allow the recipient to carry forward the unused portion as an advance for the new year. This approach usually applies when the unused amount is relatively insignificant (i.e. less than the projected expenditures for April). A note to file should be added detailing the situation.</p>
            <p>When an agreement ends and the recipient is left with a surplus during the final accounting because advances exceeded actual expenditures incurred, program delivery staff must review this balance to confirm the amount. In cases where funds then remain outstanding, the amount owed to the Department must be documented. Once the recipient has been notified and given an appropriate amount of time to repay the amount due, but fails to do so, program delivery staff can then set up an overpayment in DARS. Please refer to the Close-Out - Overpayments Chapter for information on how to manage overpayments.</p>
            <h4>10.7 Managing Payable-At-Year-End (PAYE)</h4>
            <p>The term "payable-at-year-end", or PAYE, refers to the mechanism used to process payments that occur at fiscal year-end but are paid in the new fiscal year using old year funds.</p>
            <p>All federal departments use a standard "P" and "Q" system to identify all periods and quarters of the fiscal year in which grants and contributions funds, operating and maintenance funds, and salaries are allocated, forecasted, committed and expended.</p>

            <p>This fiscal-year system is standard across the Department and must be adhered to by all staff, regardless of agreement start and end dates or the various fiscal-year systems used by recipients.</p>
            <p>When payments are due close to March 31st, program delivery staff must ensure payment is made within the old fiscal year of the original fund commitment. The timelines for handling fiscal year-end transactions change from year to year but encompass a period of about three weeks from late March to mid-April.</p>
            <p>The use of PAYE transactions should be the exception rather than the rule. That being said, take PAYE practices into account for all agreements that end near or after March 31st and discuss related issues with recipients to make appropriate arrangements; while program delivery staff must ensure claims and documentation are submitted in a timely manner, recipients must also be given adequate time to reconcile expenses with their banks, process bill payments and address other issues associated with project completion. The articles of agreement specify how many days are acceptable in order to wrap up an initiative.</p>
            <p>If the project end date is near March 31st but the recipient is unable to reconcile and submit all documentation required to close out the file by the identified deadline following fiscal year-end (period 13 --P13), then a PAYE transaction must be prepared. To charge a claim against the old fiscal year budget, one must estimate the amount of the late claim(s) and create a PAYE account for the project. Continue to communicate with the recipient in order to develop this estimate, avoid missing the P13 deadline, and minimize slippage (unused funds).</p>
            <p>Example: On March 1st, program delivery staff receives an internal announcement that P13 is April 5th to 26th. A current agreement being managed ends on March 25th. Inform the recipient that their final claim must be processed as soon as possible, but no later than April 23rd in order to allow sufficient time for verifying the claim and processing the transaction.</p>
            <p>Note that some programs may have varying capacities to re-profile funds; please refer to program-specific guidelines.<br />
            Remember that the old fiscal year accounts are closed in SAP at the end of the P13 period; after that, it is no longer possible to directly account for expenses incurred in the old fiscal year.</p>
            <p>When the claim is accepted against an old fiscal year, the system will automatically charge the expenses against the PAYE account. If the actual past fiscal year claim exceeds the PAYE funds available, the system will automatically charge the excess against the current fiscal year commitment. If the claim is less than the PAYE, the remaining funds in the PAYE will be lapsed.</p>
            <p>For agreements that rely on advance payments, please consider the following:</p>
            <p>Before setting up a PAYE transaction on an advance payments agreement, program delivery staff must confirm that the recipient has submitted an updated FPE showing the expenses covered by PAYE in the old fiscal year.</p>
            <p>SAP will automatically carry over the unaccounted advance payment balance to the new fiscal year. As a result, program delivery staff only needs to set up a PAYE transaction when the recipient&rsquo;s March claim will exceed the outstanding advances already issued.</p>
            <p>Example: On March 1st, an internal announcement is received that P13 is April 5th to 26th. A current agreement being managed started in January and ends in October.</p>
            <p>The recipient received advances of $10,000 for February and $10,000 for March, as per their FPE. They have claimed $7,000 for February but nothing yet for March.</p>
            <p>They advise the Department that they will need an estimated $13,000 to cover March expenses. Program delivery staff will not, therefore, need to set up a PAYE transaction because the $3,000 carried over from February's claim will be reconciled against the March claim if it is received early enough to process the claim before the P13 deadline on April 26th.</p>
            <p>If the recipient had forecasted $14,000 in March expenses, however, one would then have to set up a PAYE transaction for the balance of $1,000.</p>
            <p>Please note that all unused PAYEs are to be de-committed as required.</p>
            <h4>10.8 Direct Deposit</h4>
            <p>The recipient can choose to receive their grant and contribution payments by cheque or direct deposit. Direct deposit for recipients is available for all programs. A recipient must complete a <a href="http://forms-formulaires.prv/eform99/forms/FF99/ESDC-NAS5050(2015-06-004)E.pdf">Grants and Contributions Direct Deposit Request Form</a> to initiate direct deposit. The financial institution account will be tested once by depositing project funds. A program official will contact the recipient to confirm that they received the test payment. This measure helps to ensure that the payments are deposited safely and quickly. For detailed information, refer to the Direct Deposit Desk Aid.</p>
            <p>Note: PSPC is phasing out cheques, please refer to Direct Deposit Desk Aid for additional information on Direct Deposit.</p>
            <h4>10.9 Manual Payments</h4>
            <p>All grant and contribution payments must be processed in the Common System for Grants and Contributions (<abbr>CSGC</abbr>). However, exceptional situations sometimes arise where a payment cannot be processed through <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> and the only solution is to proceed with a manual payment in myEMS.</p>
            <p>Before requesting a manual payment, ensure that you have exhausted the capacities of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> file. Open a ticket in the <a href="http://collaboration/grp/Na-Bea-Cseo/_layouts/AccessDenied.aspx?Source=http%3A%2F%2Fcollaboration%2Fgrp%2FNa%2DBea%2DCseo%2FSitePages%2FHome%2Easpx&amp;Type=list&amp;name=%7BC1A420C0%2DB6EE%2D401F%2DA618%2DF870F0EB1C4D%7D">Business Expertise Request Tool (BERT)</a> so that an adviser can assist you during the process and confirm that a manual payment is the only option.<br />
            Once it has been determined that a manual payment is the only option, please refer to <a href="http://iservice.prv/eng/finance/card/procedures.shtml">Guideline on Manual Payments and Returned Funds</a> for further detail and step by step instructions.</p>
            <h4>10.10 Service Standards</h4>
            <p>The Department has established a <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-4.html">Time to Payment service standard</a>. The timeframe differs depending on whether the transfer payment method is a grant or contribution. In either case, information entered into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> for each claim allows for the performance measurement of this standard.</p>
            <p>The Time to Payment service standard states that:</p>
            <p><strong>For approved Contribution projects, the Department&rsquo;s goal is to process the payment within 28 calendar days of receiving a completed claim package.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>For approved Grant projects, the Department&rsquo;s goal is to process the payment no later than 15 calendar days after the approved project start date.</strong></p>
            <p>Concerning contributions, two mandatory sections exist in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> &ndash; a &lsquo;Date Complete Claim Received&rsquo; field (located directly beside the &lsquo;Date Claim Received&rsquo; field of the &lsquo;Capture Claim Information&rsquo; and &lsquo;Capture Close Out Claim&rsquo; screens) and the &lsquo;Authorize Transaction&rsquo; screen (which provides the date that the request is sent to SAP). Once completed, these two sections will provide an exact measurement of the contribution aspect of the Service Standard.</p>
            <p>The Service Standard&rsquo;s timeframe for grants is measured by way of two sections in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> &ndash; &lsquo;Project Start Date&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Authorize Transaction&rsquo; screen (which provides the date that the request is sent to SAP). Note that the Service Standard applies only to the first payment. Once completed, these two sections will provide an exact measurement of the grant aspect of the Service Standard.</p>
            <p>Program staff and managers are able to review individual program statistics with the aid of the four &lsquo;Speed of Service&rsquo; performance measurement reports located within the &lsquo;Operational Reports/Performance Measurement&rsquo; section of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> &ndash; &lsquo;Time to Process Claim Payments (Contributions &ndash; Progress Payments)&rsquo;; &lsquo;Time to Process Claim Payments (Contributions &ndash; Monthly Advances)&rsquo;; &lsquo;Time to Process Claim Payments (Contributions &ndash; Quarterly Advances)&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;Time to Process Installment Payments (Grants)&rsquo;.</p>

            </summary>
            <p><em>Please refer to the 2012 Ops Guide, Chapter 10 and Chapter 11</em></p>
            <h4>10.0 Monitoring</h4>
            <p>Managing projects is based, in large part, upon risk level as assessed by program delivery staff. The RAMM tool enables a comprehensive assessment of the risk factors for individual organizations and projects, and determines the level of monitoring required by project.</p>
            <p>As of December 15th, 2012, a new risk-based methodology, using the assessment information entered into the RAMM tool, has been introduced. The RAMM tool remains the same, however now the risk score is used in a more strategic way with more monitoring efforts being directed towards the highest risk areas, thus enabling a more tailored approach to managing risk.</p>
            <p>The new approach does not change the way program delivery staff assess the 10 RAMM factors. Once the 10 RAMM factors have been assessed, justified and saved, the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> advises program delivery staff on the frequency of certain risk mitigation activities, including monitoring activities (financial, activities, and results).This new approach allows the frequency of each monitoring type to be tailored to respond to the level of assessed risk of specific, pre-determined combinations of RAMM factors.</p>
            <p>The new risk-based methodology only applies to projects which have been entered into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> on, or after, December 15th, 2012. In the case of existing projects, or those entered into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> prior to December 15th, 2012, the RAMM overall risk score continues to inform the frequency of the risk mitigation activities, which includes monitoring activities (see chapter 6 for more information on risk management).</p>
            <p>The practices outlined in this chapter are standard monitoring activities and can be used in conjunction with the appropriate RAMM monitoring type. See:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>monitoring</li>
            <li>mitigation strategies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For low risk projects, mitigation strategies may include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
            <li>corrective measures;</li>
            <li>amendments;</li>
            <li>additional monitoring; and,</li>
            <li>no immediate action required;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For situations where monitoring has turned up significant issues in a project that cannot easily be mitigated and where the organization fails to take corrective action, stronger measures must be taken, such as:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>audit;</li>
            <li>probation;</li>
            <li>suspension; and,</li>
            <li>termination.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>10.1 Monitoring</h4>
            <p>Monitoring is a proactive process for managing, reviewing and problem-solving issues within a project context to ensure the agreement is implemented as approved by both parties. Regular monitoring increases the odds of project success and provides for opportunities to support the organization, anticipate potential problems and plan necessary mitigation strategies to address these problems.</p>
            <p>All monitoring activities and schedules are based on the assessed level of risk associated with each project. Lower-risk projects warrant less monitoring than higher-risk projects. The frequency of monitoring required, based on organization and project risk provides a reasonable assurance that project objectives will be met and that public funds are spent in the intended manner.</p>
            <p>Project monitoring is intended to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>verify that public funds are used as intended;</li>
            <li>verify that project activities are conducted as described in the agreement;</li>
            <li>verify that expected results are achieved as described in the agreement; and,</li>
            <li>provide support to the organization in order to support the success of the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Information gathered through monitoring helps the Department to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>review the effectiveness of procedures, systems and controls;</li>
            <li>track the performance history of project organizations;</li>
            <li>share expectations for financial accountability;</li>
            <li>develop standardized, generic tools in support of grants and contributions; and,</li>
            <li>improve upon project management practices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finally, monitoring can also be used for outcomes research and evaluation, to build corporate memory, and to promote awareness of issues and effective mitigation practices.</p>
            <h5>The Monitoring Plan</h5>
            <p>The monitoring plan (as found under the Monitoring Summary screen within <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>) describes the frequency and type of monitors that are to be performed on each particular project. The monitoring plan ultimately provides both the organization and <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> with opportunities to increase project success through strategically-planned observations and interventions. In developing a plan, agreement provisions, as well as organization needs and expectations, must be balanced against the time required to adequately monitor the agreement. The Policy on Transfer Payments requires that the level of monitoring of organizations reflects an assessment of the risks specific to the program, the value of the funding in relation to administrative costs, and the risk profile of organizations.</p>
            <p>The monitoring plan can be thought of as a virtual calendar or appointment book, as it helps organize time and workload. The completed plan details the:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>timing (when the monitoring will be conducted);</li>
            <li>frequency (how often monitoring will take place);</li>
            <li>strategies (what type of monitor will be performed and whether it will take place on-site or off-site); and,</li>
            <li>scope (what will be monitored).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While each monitoring plan should address these standard components, the plan should remain flexible enough to respond to the changing needs of the project. Any changes and alleviations to the monitoring plan must be documented on file.</p>
            <p>At a minimum, each project is to be monitored at least once for each type of monitoring (activity, financial and results) during the project lifetime. The RAMM tool and its relevant approaches identify the frequency of monitors required for each project. The monitoring plan requires that this frequency be respected. Any additional monitoring activities beyond the minimum required by RAMM must be discussed and approved, with written justification, by supervisory staff.</p>
            <p>Monitoring plans are to be reviewed and revised accordingly whenever the project risk assessment changes. This could happen as a result of an amendment to the project, or a change in circumstances (for example, change of book-keeper or withdrawal of a project partner), or simply as a result of new information. As the perceived risks of the project change, the risk assessment is to be re-assessed and the monitoring plan revised if necessary. If a new risk score modifies the frequency of monitors, program delivery staff will be advised to modify the monitoring plan. Any time the project risk assessment is revised, so, too, should the risk mitigation strategies be verified for continued applicability.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> generates a report on outstanding monitors; supervisors and program delivery staff alike are encouraged to make regular use of this feature in order to support timely project monitoring, and also encourage appropriate follow-up and the maintenance of proper documentation.</p>
            <h5>Documenting Risk Mitigation and Monitoring Activities</h5>
            <p>All program delivery staff managing a project must understand:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the risk level associated with the project and the reasons for the ranking;</li>
            <li>the need for this risk assessment and its associated monitoring plan; and,</li>
            <li>identified mitigation strategies and, if applicable, any actions taken.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All decisions made, in terms of mitigating risks and actions taken pertaining to a project, must be documented. The justification boxes in the risk assessment screen of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> capture this information. In addition, a separate text box within this same screen captures information on any additional risk mitigation strategies that have, if applicable, been implemented.</p>
            <p>Risk assessment and monitoring strategies are to be documented, as well as any required follow-up actions, the ensuing results of that follow-up, and any outstanding issues.</p>
            <p>Monitoring reports, including those completed outside of <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, must be completed and entered into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> using the ‘Record Monitoring Details screen’. Program delivery staff are to verify that any outstanding issues raised during previous monitors have been resolved and recorded, by making use of the “Follow–up required” function in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</p>
            <p>Changes in the monitoring schedule, as well as all types of informal contact with the organization, must be documented by a ‘note to file’ in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, in order to ensure the continuity of the project file. The reasons for changes to risk assessments, and the changes to risk mitigation that result, must be documented in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> using the justification dialogue boxes in the ‘Assess Project Risk’ screen.</p>
            <h5>The Monitoring Schedule using the Overall RAMM Score (projects entered into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> prior to December 15th, 2012).</h5>
            <p>RAMM is <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>’s standard tool used to assess and manage project-related levels of risk for all funding agreements entered into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> before December 15th, 2012, and signed as of April 1st, 2010, as well as for those pre-existing agreements converted to RAMM in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</p>
            <p>Monitoring under the use of the overall RAMM score:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>determines the frequency of monitoring as tailored to respond to the level of assessed risk for a particular project;</li>
            <li>defines <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> approaches according to three types of RAMM monitoring:
            <ul>
            <li>type 1: review of financial and activity report(s);</li>

            </ul>
            <p>The monitoring schedule, found below, outlines the number and type of monitoring activities program delivery staff must perform each year relative to the monitoring strategy developed for a specific project. Monitoring frequency is based upon a project’s overall level of risk; high-risk projects are monitored more frequently while low-risk projects are monitored less frequently. Hence, it is important to update the risk level rankings for each of the criteria identified in the RAMM risk assessment tool, via the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, as circumstances change, as monitoring frequencies may then change as well. The frequency of monitoring is calculated for a 12-month period and is prorated for the project duration. Note that, in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, the frequency of monitoring displayed indicates the number of monitors to be conducted for the entire duration of the project.</p>

            <p>Type 1 monitoring follows the normal route of reviewing, approving and processing claim forms and activity reports; completion status of the number of Type 1 monitors recommended by the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> does not hinder project advancement through the system.</p>
            <p>Completion of Type 2 monitors is mandatory in order to allow the project to advance through the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>. Completion of Type 2 monitors includes the monitoring and recording of both project activities and finances. All Type 2 ’Bring Forwards’ items must be completed before the project can be closed.</p>
            <p>Type 3 monitoring does not affect project advancement through the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>. These results reviews contribute to our knowledge of overall project and program effectiveness, and contribute to departmental planning cycles.</p>
            <h5>Type 1: Review of Financial and Activity Reports</h5>
            <p>The review and processing of organization claim forms and activity reports is considered a monitoring action; the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> calculates the number of claims and reports submitted and processed, and records this information as an integral part of the monitoring plan.</p>
            <p>The frequency of Type 1 monitoring reflects the project payment method, whether monthly or quarterly.</p>
            <p>Although claim forms are processed using the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, program delivery staff must confirm that project activities have also been reviewed. Type 1 monitoring must, therefore, include the review of both expenditures and activities, although these functions can be completed by two separate program delivery staff members.</p>
            <p>Due diligence should be applied when approving claims for payment under section 34 of the Financial Administration Act. Project expenditures need to be monitored sufficiently to ensure this due diligence while continuing to balance accountability with flexibility.</p>
            <p>Under normal circumstances, additional financial documentation for Type 1 monitors should not be requested. If additional, substantiating documentation is required in order to verify the financial or activity portion of the claim, one has now moved into a Type 2 monitor.</p>
            <p>Certain financial arrangements represent higher risks within a project, hence, claims review, as part of Type 1 monitoring, and should pay particular attention when these are at play. These include contracting (for goods or services), travel, hospitality, honoraria (where applicable) and all third-party arrangements or sub-contracts.</p>
            <h5>Type 2: In-depth Review of Expenditures and Activities</h5>
            <p>Type 2 monitoring is an in-depth review of both project activities and finances, whether done on or off site. Greater attention should be focused on financial transactions than during type 1 monitors.</p>
            <p>Activity monitoring involves a thorough review of: the progress of agreement activities; timelines; and, milestones.</p>
            <p>Financial monitoring involves a thorough review of financial transactions, including supporting documentation such as the general ledger or other source documents (detailed list of expenditures, invoices, receipts, cheques, etc.) On-site reviews are based on viewing original documentation, whereas off-site, paper-based monitoring requires the organization provide copies of supporting documents.</p>
            <p>Although on-site monitoring is not mandatory, a minimum number is strongly recommended.</p>
            <p>Certain program activities—such as those that are new or experimental, or involve multiple partners—can be riskier than others. Yet even the lowest risk projects require one to identify the most significant areas of potential risk and then concentrate monitoring efforts on those areas. For example, when an organization has demonstrated strong bookkeeping and financial reporting skills but has no experience with project activities, one should focus monitoring and the mitigation strategy on assuring the successful completion of project activities, and minimize the resources focused on financial monitoring.</p>
            <p>Where additional mitigation strategies are implemented to minimize potential project risks, one needs to ensure they are adequate and properly documented.</p>
            <h5>Type 3: Results Review</h5>
            <p>The RAMM approach to monitoring requires <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> officials to plan, track and record the results review independently of other kinds of monitors. Some of the information obtained during type 1 and type 2 monitors may also contribute to type 3 monitors.</p>
            <p>Essentially, type 3 monitoring looks again at why <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> funded the project and if desired results are being achieved. In other words, it moves away from project details in order to focus on the bigger picture.</p>
            <p>The information captured during type 3 monitoring looks at the impact of activities. It verifies that the project is on track to achieve the overall expected results identified in the agreement and contributes to the objectives of the program; in other words, it tells the performance story.
            It does this by:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>evaluating overall project status;</li>
            <li>identifying the impact of project intervention on the individual participant, organization, sector, industry, region, etc.; and,</li>
            <li>identifying any issues that may affect overall progress and success, such as timelines, resources, activities and milestones.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Type 3 monitoring does not necessarily involve an on-site visit; one can complete the results review by analysing activity and monitoring reports and correspondence with organizations.</p>
            <p>Whatever approach is taken, one should document answers to the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Is the project on track? Is it achieving, or on its way to achieving, the expected results set out in the agreement? Is the initial plan (activities, resources, milestones and timelines) still valid?</li>
            <li>Are there any issues that could jeopardize project success (i.e. issues that could affect the anticipated results of the project)?</li>
            <li>How does, or will, the project contribute to the overall program objective or outcomes?</li>
            <li>List any outputs or results achieved to date.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ultimately, results monitoring should reflect the program terms and conditions as well as the objectives and intended outcomes for the particular project and program. Expected results and outcomes need to be clearly articulated in the project agreement in order to facilitate the task of monitoring.</p>

            <p>As of December 15th, 2012, (as detailed in Chapter 6), the frequency of each type of monitoring, whether financial, activity, or results, is determined based on different pre-set combinations of five RAMM factors that are relevant to that monitoring type.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff assess the 10 RAMM factors, justify the risk level selected and save their assessment. The frequency of monitoring is then system generated and is displayed on the Monitoring Summary screen.</p>

            <li>one during the period of May 21st, 2014 to June 19th, 2014.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Considerations:</p>
            <p>When conducting a monitor, program delivery staff may decide to focus on only one monitor type as number of monitors per type varies. For example, in the case of the project mentioned above, three activity monitors will be conducted during the lifetime of the project, but only two financial monitors will be conducted for the same project, meaning at least one activity monitor will be conducted on its own.</p>
            <p>Low Financial Risk – If a low financial risk project has a duration of one year or less, the financial monitor should be done approximately ¾ into the project. The first month should be reviewed randomly for all cost categories to verify that no expenses were incurred prior to the start date, and to identify the expenditures that are claimed to a specific line item. Review randomly the cost categories that can be contentious (e.g. capital costs, direct costs, etc.). If the project has a low financial risk and is more than one year in duration, then the financial monitor can be conducted mid-way or ¾ way through the project with a consideration to the first month of the agreement as explained above.</p>
            <p>Medium Financial Risk – When the monitor is conducted will depend upon the duration of the agreement. In the first year, the monitor can be conducted shortly after the first quarter or, at the latest, by the mid-year point, in order to ensure that the organization has understood the requirements which were discussed during the initial visit. If issues exist, mitigation strategies could then be put into place at that time. Again, the first month should be reviewed to verify that no expenses were incurred prior to the start date, and then following periods reviewed randomly thereafter on an annual basis. It is suggested that all invoices and expenses for the first month of the agreement be reviewed.</p>
            <p>High Financial Risk – The monitor must be conducted by the mid-year point (6 months) in order to verify that the organization has understood the requirements which were discussed during the initial contact. Again, the first month should be reviewed to verify that no expenses were incurred prior to the start date, and then following periods reviewed randomly thereafter on a semi-annual basis. It is suggested that all invoices and expenses for the first month of the agreement be reviewed.</p>
            <p><strong>Monitoring Tools for all Types of Risk Based Approaches (based on RAMM overall score or based on scores of pre-determined combinations of RAMM factors)</strong></p>
            <p>As one prepares to conduct a financial, activity or result monitor, the appropriate training, tools and documentation will be required.</p>
            <p>Key to this task are the agreement, observations on the part of program delivery staff, a basic knowledge of accounting principles, and a thorough understanding of the program’s terms and conditions and operational guidelines.</p>
            <p>One should have the following items when conducting a monitor :</p>
            <ul>
            <li>a copy of the project agreement and its schedules, and the project's forecast of project expenditures;</li>
            <li>copies of any financial records and activity reports relating to the agreement that have been received from the organization;</li>
            <li>any previous claim forms submitted;</li>
            <li>other documents related to project activities, such as annual reports, conference reports, magazine articles, records of discussions/decisions, and participant feedback,;</li>
            <li>a calculator; and,</li>
            <li>a copy of the On-Site Monitoring Report (or a program’s equivalent form), which documents the results of a monitor. Part A is used to document activity monitoring. Part B focuses primarily on a review of financial records and administrative systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Monitoring may take place either on or off the organization’s premises. The frequency and type of monitoring need to strike a balance between the nature of the risks involved, and the resources available. For example, an off-site monitoring may be more appropriate for high-risk projects located in remote areas.</p>
            <p>On- or off-site monitoring can be applied to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>project activities;</li>
            <li>project expenditures and financial records; and,</li>
            <li>project results.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Off-site Monitoring</h5>
            <p>Off-site monitors are less expensive and a more convenient way to conduct
            either activity, financial or result monitors. They are usually an adequate approach to monitoring lower-risk projects where the organization has a good track record, and no significant problems are foreseen. That said, they are often used in combination with on- site monitoring.</p>
            <p>There are two main types of off-site monitoring:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>a paper-based review; and,</li>
            <li>direct contact monitor.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>All off-site monitors should be scheduled, and completed, during the life of the agreement.</p>
            <p>If any issues were identified during the monitoring, program delivery staff must return to the RAMM tool and re-assess the RAMM factors and, if applicable, update the information (in the justification boxes), as updated information may affect the risk assessment and, consequently, the frequency of monitoring. If any changes are made to the RAMM tool (risk levels and/or justifications) the program delivery staff needs to save the updated information. The supervisory staff is responsible to ensure that a re- assessment of the RAMM factors and their justifications have been completed by the program delivery staff.</p>
            <h5>Paper-based Review</h5>
            <p>To conduct a paper-based or file documentation review for a financial monitor:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Select a claim period</strong>, preferably early in the life of the agreement;</li>
            <li><strong>Review the claim form</strong> to verify that expenditures relate directly to activities as
            described in the activity report;</li>
            <li><strong>Select one or more cost categories and request</strong> the substantiating documentation, such as invoices or payroll records, for expenditures claimed under these cost categories. Note that administrative costs subject to flat rate (under cost category Set A – Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities {OF} and Skills Link are not monitored);</li>
            <li>Based on a review of supporting documentation, <strong>determine whether the amounts claimed in the selected cost categories are eligible</strong> under the agreement;</li>

            <li>Have milestones, timelines and deliverables been met for the specific period being monitored?</li>
            <li>Has there been any amendments to the agreement? Is there a need to modify the agreement to reflect the changes in activities, milestones or timelines?</li>
            <li>Have any partnership commitments been achieved?</li>
            <li>Have any project staff members or participants left the project since the last monitor or project start date? If so, why? Have they been replaced? Have any additional project employees been hired since the last monitor or project start date?</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Follow up on any discrepancies</strong> by contacting the organization to seek clarification:
            <ul>

            <li>Are there any results related issues that could jeopardize the success of the project?</li>
            <li>How does or will this project contribute to the overall program objectives/outcome(s)? (Contribution to the program)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>List any outputs and/or results</strong> achieved to date.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow up on any discrepancies</strong> by contacting the organization to seek clarification:
            <ul>
            <li>When discrepancies are found, request substantiating documentation until
            sufficient information has been provided to address the problem.</li>

            </ul>
            <h5>Direct Contact Monitor</h5>
            <p>Every form of communication can help ensure project activities are achieving expected outcomes and to address promptly any issues that may jeopardize the success of a project. All communication with the organization and other key players should be documented as ‘notes to file’ in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Electronic communication</strong>: Copies of all correspondence, including e-mails, written correspondence, and faxes, should be kept on file either in the document location of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> or in the paper file.</li>
            <li><strong>Correspondence</strong>: Any written correspondence between <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> and the organization can be used to track progress on project activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Phone contact</strong>: This gives one an opportunity to explain and clarify written information, as well as to verify observations made during an on-site visit.</li>
            <li><strong>Teleconferencing or video teleconferencing</strong>: These are effective tools for holding distance meetings that involve groups from both inside and outside of the Department when both parties have access to the necessary technology.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To conduct a direct contact monitor:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Select a claim period, preferably following a paper-based, or file documentation, review;</li>
            <li>Contact the organization to discuss the project’s progress and ask the following questions:
            <ul>
            <li>How are project activities proceeding relative to what is outlined in the agreement?</li>
            <li>What milestones or deliverables have been met during this period, as described in the agreement?</li>
            <li>What partnership commitments have been realized?</li>
            <li>Have any project staff members or participants left since the last monitor or project start date? If so, why? Have any new employees been replaced? If so, why? Have any additional project employees been hired since the last monitor or project start date?</li>
            <li>Are there any difficulties with the project? Can they be described? What might be some possible solutions?;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Contact participants</strong> to determine whether their needs, as described in the agreement, are being met;</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate with project partners and stakeholders</strong> to verify that project activities are proceeding as planned;</li>
            <li><strong>Request substantiating documentation</strong> from the organization, for some or for all cost categories, including copies of invoices, financial records, reports and deliverables for the selected claim period. Note that administrative costs subject to flat rate (under cost category Set A – Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities {OF} and Skills Link) are not monitored;</li>
            <li>Based on a review of the supporting documentation, <strong>determine whether the amounts claimed are eligible</strong> under the agreement and directly relate to project activities;</li>
            <li><strong>Follow up on any discrepancies</strong> by contacting the organization to seek clarification;</li>
            <li><strong>When discrepancies have been found, request substantiating documentation</strong> until there is evidence that the organization has addressed the problem. Depending upon the type of discrepancy found and its resolution, one may decide to adjust the RAMM assessment to determine a revised monitoring strategy in order to address a higher level of risk; and,</li>
            <li><strong>Document the direct contact monitor</strong> in the project file and the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> using the Record Monitoring Details screen.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>On-site Monitor</h5>
            <p>On-site monitoring consists of face-to-face meetings with the organization and others— the bookkeeper, project staff, project participants, etc.—on the premises where their financial records are kept and project activities held. It is generally associated with higher-risk agreements and may involve:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>a direct review of the organization’s financial records;</li>
            <li>a visit to project locations; or,</li>
            <li>interviews with project participants (if applicable).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On-site monitoring has the advantage of personal contact with the organization and makes it easy to observe the project first-hand, meet with other key players and evaluate the consistency of information gathered from written reports and other contacts. All on- site monitors should be scheduled, and completed, during the life of the agreement.</p>
            <p>The monitoring visit itself is, of course, the focal activity and requires careful preparation.</p>
            <p>When conducting an on-site financial or activity monitor, one should :</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>verify that activities</strong> undertaken correspond to those in the agreement;</li>
            <li><strong>verify that all organization documentation</strong> received, such as financial and activity reports, <strong>correspond with documentation on the organization's premises;</strong></li>
            <li><strong>verify that all cash and in-kind contributions have been verified and that supporting documentation is on file.</strong> Organizations should demonstrate that partners have submitted both the cash and in-kind contribution amounts for the time period being monitored. Organizations are held accountable to track and, at the end of the project, report on all contributions received from other sources; and,</li>
            <li><strong>complete the detailed checklists</strong> on the On-site Monitoring Report form (or the program’s equivalent form), noting any issues of concern, and possible follow-up action, such as subsequent visits or off-site monitoring. Enter these details into the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> <em>Record Monitoring Details</em> screen.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While most on-site monitoring is planned in advance, the schedule should be flexible enough to include spontaneous monitoring, particularly when there are performance concerns or discrepancies between what is reported and results from previous visits.</p>
            <p>On-site monitoring can be time-consuming; it also doesn't allow for continuity and communication between visits. For that reason, when planning the monitoring schedule, ensure projects are adequately monitored based on the level of risk and that on-site and off-site monitors are used appropriately.</p>
            <h5>Monitoring Visits</h5>
            <p>The number of monitors is generated by the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> through the risk assessment. Although one may want to concentrate on a single aspect (activities, finances or results), other issues might come to light that could either be delved into immediately or at a later date.</p>
            <p>When planning a project’s monitoring visits, verify that, over the life of the agreement, finances, activities and results are reviewed.</p>
            <p>To plan a monitoring visit, one should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>initiate the visit;</li>
            <li>prepare for the visit; and,</li>
            <li>confirm arrangements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once on site, one should take specific steps when undertaking an:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>activity monitor;</li>
            <li>financial monitor; and</li>
            <li>result monitor</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If any issues were identified during the monitoring, program delivery staff must return to the RAMM tool and re-assess the RAMM factors and, if applicable, update the information (in the justification boxes), as updated information may affect the risk assessment and, consequently, the frequency of monitoring. If any changes are made to the RAMM tool (risk levels and/or justifications) the program delivery staff needs to save the updated information. The supervisory staff is responsible to ensure that a re- assessment of the RAMM factors and their justifications have been completed by the program delivery staff.</p>
            <h5>Initiating the Visit</h5>
            <p>Before contacting the organization to set up the monitoring visit, one should take the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Clearly define the purpose of the monitor. For example: the purpose of this visit is to review activities conducted during a claim period and verify amounts shown on the claim.</li>
            <li>Establish the monitoring period, if applicable.</li>
            <li>Assess the environment in which the monitor will be conducted. This assessment may identify key areas to investigate, such as previously identified trouble spots. Consider:
            <ul>
            <li>organization willingness to cooperate and disclose information;</li>
            <li>how project administrative files are kept (are they organized or scattered throughout the office?);</li>
            <li>organization willingness to allow the interviewing of participants and personnel;</li>
            <li>openness of the organization to allow for the observation of a training session for the clients; and,</li>
            <li>whether the organization keeps appointments.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Decide whether this will be:
            <ul>
            <li>A planned visit, which is most often the case. Advise the organization ahead of time, stating the purpose of the visit and the information they must have ready for review. Ensure the project coordinator and bookkeeper will be available to explain their accounting procedures so that the accounts and expenditures can be verified.</li>
            <li>A spontaneous visit: There may be times when a spontaneous visit is more appropriate. For example: if reports are received indicating that something is going wrong or there is no evidence of work being done, a surprise visit may offer a more clear understanding these concerns.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Preparing for the Visit</h5>
            <p>In the days leading up to a meeting with the organization, one should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>review the agreement, previous claims, activity reports and, if applicable,participant information;</li>
            <li>develop a clear understanding of the agreement;</li>
            <li>prepare questions to ask based on information already in the project file such asclaim forms, activity reports, etc.;</li>
            <li>review previous monitoring reports to identify any specific areas for follow-up;</li>
            <li>ascertain what has to be accomplished during the visit (measuring successindicators, financial and activity indicators, reviewing the agreement,amendments, etc.);</li>
            <li>prioritize the work hoped to be accomplished during the visit;</li>
            <li>decide how to conduct the visit -- who should be interviewed? What questionsshould be asked? What records should be verified;</li>
            <li>identify key contacts within the organization and ensure their availability(bookkeeper, project manager, etc.);</li>
            <li>remind the organization of the upcoming visit and request any supportingdocumentation that is needed ahead of time to ensure it is ready for review uponarrival; and,</li>
            <li>collect the documents and equipment required for the meeting (copy of theagreement, last claim form, calculator, on-site monitoring report, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Confirming Arrangements</h5>
            <p>Just before the visit, one should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>confirm the appointment with the organization, ensuring that all staff,documentation and participants will be available; and,</li>
            <li>verify the length of the visit, allowing enough time to talk informally with theorganization, participants (if appropriate) and project staff.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Interim Visit</h5>
            <p>Once the project is underway, ongoing monitoring activities take place according to the monitoring schedule, which is based on risk assessment results. Where the initial visit (not considered a monitor) verifies all necessary financial and organizational supports are in place, interim visits follow up on project activities and results, and monitor finances to verify expenditures.</p>
            <p>In conjunction with other monitoring activities, interim monitoring visits should address the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Are activities consistent with the agreement? Which activities are progressing particularly well?</li>
            <li>Which activities are not progressing as well and appear to be problematic?</li>
            <li>How are participants progressing (if applicable)? Is project administration—office and financial procedures—sufficient for the project?</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Activity Monitor</h5>
            <p>Activity monitoring addresses:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>project objectives and outcomes to answer the question “What’s going on?” using bothqualitative and quantitative information;</li>
            <li>activity progress and milestones to ensure that activities are being carried out asdescribed in the funding agreement; and,</li>
            <li>participant progress (if applicable) to assess the quality of participantdevelopment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On-site activity monitoring involves the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Interview the organization and key project staff (such as the project coordinator).State the purpose of the visit, ask for a detailed description of project activities to dateand answer the following questions:
            <ul>
            <li>Are project activities in line with those described in the agreement?</li>
            <li>Did any activities occur prior to the agreement start date?</li>
            <li>Are activities progressing as per the agreement?</li>
            <li>Which deliverables (e.g. processes, tools, training, best practices, guides) havebeen completed by this point in the project?</li>
            <li>Have any issues arisen to date?</li>
            <li>Are any amendments to the agreement required?</li>
            <li>Is there appropriate <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> visibility?</li>
            <li>Have partnership commitments been realized?</li>
            <li>Have new employees been hired since the last monitor or project start-up?</li>
            <li>Have any employees been replaced? If so, why?</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Interview participants, if applicable, to confirm activities have taken place andprogress is being made. Ask the following questions:
            <ul>
            <li>Are participants aware of other <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> services websites or services offered?Are these appropriate for participants?</li>
            <li>Is each participant aware of, and following, the applicable work activities,development or personal action plan?</li>
            <li>Are they being properly supervised?</li>
            <li>Are there any safety concerns?</li>
            <li>Are they receiving income support?</li>
            <li>Have they been receiving their cheques on time?</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Visit project premises to ensure they are appropriate for project activities and thatadequate safety measures and equipment are in place.</li>
            <li>Observe participants during activities and verify that they are performing these asspecified in the funding agreement.</li>
            <li>Discuss participant progress with project staff.</li>
            <li>Ask for any evidence that activities have taken place, including meeting minutes,conference reports, workshop agendas, etc.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Financial Monitor</h5>
            <p> Financial monitoring verifies that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>bookkeeping systems and accounting practices are in place to manage and controlHRSDC funds; and,</li>
            <li>the money is being spent as outlined within the funding agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Project expenditures should be monitored once, as a minimum, during the life of the agreement, and more often, if warranted by the assessed risk level. The importance and frequency of financial monitoring increases as the level of risk increases.</p>
            <p>Once it is felt that a complete understanding of an organization’s bookkeeping systems and accounting practices has been attained, one is ready to undertake the financial monitor itself.</p>
            <h5>Final or Close-out Contact</h5>
            <p>A final or close-out contact is the opportunity to address any outstanding matters that should be resolved prior to the conclusion of the project. One should also remind the organization to submit a close-out activity report and final claim form, while informing them of when the report is due and how it should be completed. One of the monitoring activities identified in the monitoring plan (<abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> monitoring summary) may be considered the final or close-out monitoring if it is conducted and completed during the life of the agreement.</p>
            <p>Given individual project circumstances and program capacity and resources, a final visit may not be practical or warranted. In cases where a final visit is possible or necessary, which activities remain incomplete and how quickly the file can be closed can be established.</p>
            <p>Prior to this final contact, program delivery staff should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>review the agreement, amendments (if applicable), monitoring reports and notes to file;</li>
            <li>if warranted, do a monitor using the On-site Financial Monitoring Report Form (or the program’s equivalent form); and,</li>
            <li>complete the Final Close-out Summary Form (or the program’s equivalent form) to document findings, comments and recommendations; in particular, note any anomalies or difficulties the organization encountered during the project’s life cycle and how they resolved them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Final contact should verify:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>all follow-up issues and outstanding matters have been settled satisfactorily;</li>
            <li>agreement activities have been completed and objectives met;</li>
            <li>all expenditures were related to contracted activities within the specified project duration (note that organizations may be allowed to incur administrative costs that may not be directly related to the project but are necessary for the organization to function effectively as a whole {cost category Set B});</li>
            <li>financial records are up-to-date and complete;</li>
            <li>all remittances and participant-related documentation are in order (e.g. Receiver General remittances, vacation pay, Records of Employment {ROE} completed, T4s or T4As in process);</li>
            <li>capital assets have been dealt with as per the agreement;</li>
            <li>storage of records and files has been arranged;</li>
            <li>the final report regarding project results is on file; and,</li>
            <li>where the project is related to work experience, the number of successful participants is confirmed, follow-up questionnaires have been completed and outcomes recorded in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>10.2 Understanding the Organization's Administrative Processes</h4>
            <p>The many and varied accounting and financial systems used by organizations to manage agreement funds can easily take the monitoring of certain types of projects well beyond the expertise of most program delivery staff. When such complex accounting practices are encountered, ask project organizations to explain their accounting procedures by adopting a "show me" attitude to verify accounts and expenditures. If difficulty is encountered in understanding the financial information they provide, get help from someone with an accounting background (a co-worker or finance officer). One may even wish to bring them along if one is performing a financial monitor on site.</p>
            <p>While accounting credentials are not required to do a financial monitor, a basic knowledge of accounting will help complete this assignment. First, learn to distinguish between the concepts of bookkeeping and accounting. While bookkeeping is the recording of transactions, accounting includes the design of accounting management and control, the preparation of financial statements, and the analysis and interpretation of accounting information as an aid to making business decisions. The purpose of accounting is to provide financial information about any economic entity, in this case the project. It extends beyond creating records and reports to realizing the ultimate objective of being able to use, analyze and interpret the information gathered. Organizations must demonstrate both adequate bookkeeping and accounting practices.</p>
            <p>Within this context, as the person conducting the financial monitor, program delivery staff should, therefore, understand:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Canadian and international accounting standards (that is appropriate to the magnitude of the project);</li>
            <li>what constitutes a good record-keeping system;</li>
            <li>the purpose of internal control systems; and,</li>
            <li>how to assess the quality of these systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, these four elements ensure accurate recording, summarizing, reporting and interpretation of financial information.
            If one is not yet familiar with the organization's accounting, payroll and other administrative procedures when setting out to do a financial monitor visit, ask the organization or bookkeeper to describe:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>how they manage funds;</li>
            <li>what accounting procedures and systems they use;</li>
            <li>how payments are authorized and by whom;</li>
            <li>who has the authority to spend funds; and,</li>
            <li>what the procedures are for signing cheques.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following sections describe the attributes of sound bookkeeping and accounting practices:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>record-keeping systems</li>
            <li>internal control systems</li>
            <li>general ledger</li>
            <li>petty cash</li>
            <li>cheque register</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For organizations who do not have access to an accounting system (whether manual or computerized), one can offer them sample accounting forms to help them keep adequate financial records, including the receipts and disbursement record form, payroll record form, and calculation of monthly remittances form. Noted that the use of such sample accounting forms is by no means mandatory and should only be offered to organizations as a resource.</p>
            <h5>Canadian and International Accounting Standards</h5>
            <p><abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> program delivery staff should have a basic understanding of two important accounting models:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the current use of Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</li>
            <li>the recent introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While not specific to the Department, they are both highly influential within the organizations that <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> deals with on a daily basis, guiding the setup and administration of their financial systems.</p>
            <p>For more information and resources on both, see the Canadian Accounting Standards Board and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA).</p>
            <h5>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</h5>
            <p><abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> program delivery staff should develop an understanding of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) used in Canada to support their examination of an organization's accounting practices when monitoring individual projects, as well as efforts to track monitoring across entire programs. These rules or standards support the integrity of financial information and the ability to compare current financial reports to prior period reports, and the reports of other businesses and organizations. The accounting profession has adopted these principles as guidelines for maintaining financial accounts and producing financial reports.</p>
            <p>Starting in 2011, all publicly-traded companies and financial institutions will have to apply the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in lieu of the GAAP. While governments, not-for-profit and private organizations are not required to implement IFRS in their accounting systems, they may elect to do so for the benefit of their stakeholders.</p>
            <p>In short, GAAP practices are founded upon the following principles:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The business entity principle considers how the reader will interpret information concerning the entity contained in the report. Accountants sometimes prepare consolidated reports for a corporation that has many divisions. Each division, however, may also generate reports when they are operated as distinct profit centres.</li>
            <li><strong>The continuity or going-concern principle</strong> implies the business will continue to exist long enough to carry out preset plans and meet contractual commitments.</li>
            <li><strong>The monetary principle</strong> assumes the unit of measurement is money and that, in Canada, that unit of measurement is the Canadian dollar unless otherwise noted.</li>
            <li><strong>The time-period principle:</strong> Although accounting periods can be as short as one month or one quarter, the normal accounting period is one “fiscal” year that begins on a given day and ends 12 months later. When two or more financial reports are compared, one must, therefore, ensure that they entail comparable time periods.</li>
            <li><strong>The cost principle:</strong> When the transaction is recorded, the associated cost usually represents the fair market value of the goods or services as stated on the receipt or agreement. With the passage of time, the economic value of an asset may change greatly, particularly in periods of inflation. The cost principle, however, requires that the historical cost (rather than a later "fair market value" cost) continue to serve as the basis for values in financial statements.</li>
            <li><strong>The revenue principle:</strong> For any given period, revenue refers to the monies collected as cash or receivables from sales or other means during that period. Revenue is recorded when the sale is made, not when the goods are manufactured.</li>
            <li><strong>The matching principle</strong> states that the costs associated with revenue realized during a given period must be recorded in that same period. For organizations with a funding agreement, this means they must report and claim the interest revenue earned on <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>'s contribution for the period in which it was earned, not the period in which it was received. The costs incurred to earn the interest revenue would be matched in the same period.</li>
            <li><strong>The objectivity principle:</strong> As much as possible, accounting should be based on objective evidence, such as verifiable invoices and contracts. The term "verify" indicates to prove something by examination of the evidence or underlying facts.</li>
            <li><strong>The consistency principle:</strong> An organization’s annual financial reports must be comparable from one period to another in order to identify trends. For this comparison to be useful, accounting principles must be applied consistently from one period to another and changes noted in financial statements.</li>
            <li><strong>The disclosure principle</strong> requires that financial statements include all information necessary to provide a fair presentation of an organization’s financial position. The concept of financial disclosure applies not only to transactions that occur during the reported period, but also to additional information that affects the business (e.g. a legal proceeding). When an organization’s financial statements are monitored, therefore, make sure to also review all accompanying notes as well as the financial data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If it is found during a monitor that all of these functions are performed by the same individual within an organization, the internal controls should be more closely examined and the project may require more in-depth monitoring.</p>
            <h5>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)</h5>
            <p>Starting in 2011, all publicly-traded companies and financial institutions in Canada will have to apply the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) instead of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). While governments, not-for-profit and private organizations are not required to implement IFRS in their accounting systems, they may elect to do so for the benefit of their stakeholders.</p>
            <p>If <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> enters into agreements with companies or organizations using the IFRS, some knowledge of these standards will, therefore, be required to do financial monitoring.</p>
            <p>Essentially, the IFRS is a collection of international accounting standards that promotes the reporting of transparent, comparable information in financial statements. Although not identical to the Canadian GAAP, these new standards are based on a similar conceptual framework. Adoption of the globally-accepted IFRS system will, ideally, increase access to world-wide capital markets for Canadian businesses, streamline international accounting practices and, thus, enhance the clarity and comparability of financial information around the world.</p>
            <p>For more information on the IFRS as industry prepares for their adoption, see the IFRS section of the Canadian Institute for Chartered Accountants website.</p>
            <h5>Record-keeping Systems</h5>
            <p>Record-keeping systems are the ways in which organizations track their financial activities; during a financial monitor, program delivery staff are required to examine the quality of this system.</p>
            <p>While they vary from organization to organization, good record-keeping systems are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear:</strong> If accounting information is to be useful, it must be presented in terms that are understandable to the user. Sometimes, however, the complex nature of the business prevents simple reporting. In such situations, one should ask the organization to explain how a transaction is recorded, then track an expense through the stages of receipt, to payment, to its resulting financial statement.</li>
            <li>Verifiable: If accounting information is verifiable, any person can find evidence of the transaction. For example, to verify the number of employees in a given project, view payroll records, transactions of salaries paid, and deductions to individuals reported as part of the project.</li>
            <li>Up to date: Since the basic reason for developing accounting information is to use it in making decisions, this information must be recorded in a timely fashion to help the user determine forecast of project expenditures requirements, assess variance from budget, and measure outcomes against financial resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent:</strong> Consistency is key to ensuring financial reports are comparable from one reporting period to another (i.e. they must use the same eligible cost category each time an expense is recorded). Similarities and differences appearing in the financial statements must, therefore, reflect basic conditions in the organization and not merely differences in the accounting treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>Complete:</strong> Financial reporting must include all financial transactions and information; this is often referred to as "full disclosure". Complete financial information and its full disclosure facilitate understanding and avoid misleading implications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Internal Control Systems</h5>
            <p>Program delivery staff are required to examine the organization's system of internal control, or measures they take to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>protect resources against waste, fraud and inefficiency;</li>
            <li>ensure accuracy and reliability in accounting and reporting data;</li>
            <li>guarantee compliance with the funding agreement and other <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> requirements; and,</li>
            <li>evaluate project performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A good system of internal control will ensure that no one person handles all phases of a transaction from beginning to end.</p>
            <p>To check the effectiveness of an organization’s internal control system, review the process for purchasing project goods and services by asking the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Who recommends purchases, approves and signs purchase orders, etc.?</li>
            <li>How many signatures are required on cheques?</li>
            <li>Who reviews and signs claim forms?</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>General Ledger</h5>
            <p> The general ledger is a record or book that includes all of the different asset, liability, revenue and expense accounts listed in the chart of accounts. Every once in a while—but usually within predetermined time frames—all entries from the general journal (a chronological record of all transactions) are transferred or "posted" into the general ledger.</p>
            <p>Unlike the general journal, the general ledger is set up using the chart of accounts with each account having a debit, credit and balance column. The balance column keeps an up-to-date balance of each separate account when posted.</p>
            <p>An organization can use the general ledger to produce useful financial reports such as a trial balance, an income statement, a balance sheet and other financial statements. The information contained within the general ledger also assists the organization in filling out the claim form required by the Department.</p>
            <h5>Petty Cash</h5>
            <p>Petty cash is money kept on hand or in a special bank account as a convenient way to make small payments. If the organization uses petty cash as a method of reimbursing expenses, all petty cash transactions must be clearly documented and supported by appropriate receipts or vouchers.</p>
            <p>These receipts should be listed in the petty cash register and include the:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>date of purchase;</li>
            <li>name of the vendor;</li>
            <li>description of the item;</li>
            <li>amount paid;</li>
            <li>chart of account name and number for the disbursement(s);</li>
            <li>GST amount; and,</li>
            <li>balance remaining in the petty cash fund.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All receipts should be filed in support of any cheques issued to reimburse the petty cash fund, and the petty cash register must be updated and documented accordingly. The register should be signed and dated by any person receiving a cash disbursement. At any given time, the total of receipts and vouchers, plus the cash on hand, must equal the original amount of the petty cash fund.</p>
            <h5>Cheque Register</h5>
            <p>Program delivery staff should encourage organizations to use a cheque register to record all issued cheques and thus assist in the project's record keeping. It is good practice to use cheques that are pre-numbered by the bank. If the organization's financial systems are automated, they may produce cheques automatically, but this does not negate any alternate processes.</p>
            <p>Cheques should be entered sequentially in the cheque register. Any missing numbered cheques should be accounted for and the appropriate cheque stub with the signature(s) attached to the register.</p>
            <h4>10.3 Undertaking a Financial Monitor</h4>
            <p>Essentially, the role of program delivery staff in carrying out a financial monitor is to ensure that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>all expenditures are eligible, given the project's objectives, and in accordance with the clauses of the agreement;</li>
            <li>the amount paid is reasonable;</li>
            <li>the item exists or the service has been performed; and,</li>
            <li>the purchase is supported by appropriate documentation. To conduct a financial monitor, one can take the following steps:
            <ul>
            <li>Become familiar with the financial requirements outlined in the agreement, reviewing which cost category set the projects falls under, and reviewing financial information sources such as the:
            <ul>
            <li>chart of accounts;</li>
            <li>accounts payable and receivable records;</li>
            <li>bank statements and cancelled cheques; o claim form(s);</li>
            <li>general ledger and sub-ledger;</li>
            <li>cheque register;</li>
            <li>cash receipts and invoices;</li>
            <li>payroll journals and evidence of support to individuals;</li>
            <li>Receiver General remittances; and,</li>
            <li>petty cash records.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Verify capital costs and project administrative costs.</li>
            <li>Use a sampling approach—a test of payroll transactions and non-payroll expenditures—because there is no need to review 100% of the entries or cheques. Generally, start with five of each type of transaction. If concerns or issues arise, increase the sample size. For further information, see Treasury Board Financial Management, Expenditure and Cost Management, Account Verification, Appendix A - Account Verification.</li>
            <li>If there is an area of concern, review 100% of all expenditures in that area.</li>
            <li>Check petty cash and cheque stubs first.</li>
            <li>Choose some entries and books, and track them back to their origin.</li>
            <li>Select some cheques and track the corresponding invoices and entries.</li>
            <li>Always ask for bank reconciliations.</li>
            <li>Investigate any item outstanding on bank reconciliations for more than two months.</li>
            <li>Compare previous months’ figures to previous months’ claim form(s).</li>
            <li>Initial all verified documents, as this will provide an audit trail for future reviews.</li>
            <li>Verify that cheques payable to signing officers are for valid, adequately-supported project expenses.</li>
            <li>Confirm that there are two or more signing officers for non-profit organizations.</li>
            <li>Never remove original financial records from the agreement site; if necessary, ask for photocopies of anything required.</li>
            <li>If one finds expenses that are incorrectly recorded or classified improperly while monitoring a project’s financial records, advise the organization and make a note to file to ensure proper follow-up.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If mistakes or other problems in the financial records of a project are encountered, do not attempt to correct these as this is not the role of program delivery staff. The organization has signed an agreement stating they will maintain the project's financial accounts in proper order; the organization and their bookkeeper must, therefore, learn from the observations of program delivery staff and take corrective action on their own. Ask them about their plans to correct the problems identified and ensure a time is agreed upon for correction so this can be verified as part of the next planned monitor.</p>
            <p>During an on-site financial monitor, one can also ask oneself the following questions to ensure the necessary information is gathered:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Were all expenditures incurred after the agreement start date? Look at invoice and purchase order dates.</li>
            <li>Was the item purchased necessary to complete project activities? Ask the organization what it is used for and how often it is used. If appropriate, ask for a demonstration. This may not be applicable, depending upon the cost category set used.</li>
            <li>Was the purchase cost reasonable? Compare the price paid to the market value for similar products or services.</li>
            <li>Did the organization follow guidelines concerning the acquisition and disposal of capital assets? Visually inspect the proof of purchase. Determine if the organization followed agreement provisions when acquiring and disposing of capital assets.</li>
            <li>Were the costs incurred within the maximum allowable? Check these against theagreement schedule that details eligible costs.</li>
            <li>Are receipts available to verify amounts paid? Ask to see receipts for actual costsincurred for the item that were previously identified.</li>
            <li>Are any purchased items located on project premises? Look for and count significantitems (i.e. if the invoice indicates 10 computers were purchased, look for them. Ifthey cannot all be accounted for, ask the organization where they are).</li>
            <li>Is the organization keeping accurate, up-to-date records in either a computerized ormanual accounting system? (Most computerized systems post transactionsimmediately while manual systems are usually posted at least twice a month.) Ask theorganization to show how they have kept specific information, such as payrollinformation, attendance records, invoices, etc. Have them describe how they processvarious financial transactions for the project. Confirm the delegated signing authority.Determine whether the organization has retained project financial records separatefrom those of the parent organization, if appropriate.</li>
            <li>Is the use and application of funds consistent with agreement provisions?Interview both the organization and participants to learn the status of theiractivities with respect to Schedule A.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Review of Claim Forms</h5>
            <p>Prior to doing a financial monitor, review the claim form(s) submitted by the organization for the period covered by the monitor and ensure that the total on the claim form is mathematically correct and consistent with the forecast of project expenditures. During the monitor, expenses can then be verified and supported, as necessary, by appropriate documentation such as invoices. Follow the audit trail to monitor expenditures claimed; in practice, this means one should compare the claim form to source documents such as payroll records, invoices, cheques, general ledgers and bank reconciliations. Select and analyze expenditures (consider targeting those items of significant amount) from each of the eligible cost (and sub-costs) categories outlined in the agreement, such as staff wages, capital assets, participant costs and project costs.</p>
            <h5>Cash Receipts</h5>
            <p>Some projects receive cash from selling products or services. In these instances, program delivery staff should encourage organizations to keep a register of cash receipts and record all business sales, including those paid by cash or credit. This register or ledger shows the money actually coming in (as opposed to the sales journal which lists all sales, even those where money has not yet been received) and is used to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>track all money entering the organization;</li>
            <li>meet the requirements of revenue-producing projects;</li>
            <li>record sales and revenues;</li>
            <li>update accounts receivable records; and,</li>
            <li>meet Canada Revenue Agency taxation requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One can monitor the cash receipts register to track revenue from other sources. When assessing this:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>ensure it is up to date;</li>
            <li>make certain it is done daily or weekly;</li>
            <li>go through the deposit slips and compare them to the bank statement;</li>
            <li>review the amount of <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> cheques received and recorded on register andcompare this to <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> payment records;</li>
            <li>verify that cheques issued by <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr> have been recorded and deposited in the correct bank account;</li>
            <li>confirm that all cash went into the proper account; and,</li>
            <li>check the dollar value, the date, from whom the money was received, and what it was used to pay for.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Payroll Journals</h5>
            <p>Payroll is usually the largest expense in <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>-funded projects and, therefore, merits particularly close scrutiny during a financial monitor.</p>
            <p>A payroll is any system by which the total wages earned by employees and the total deductions made against those wages are recorded for a specified period of employment.</p>
            <p>All payroll records should show each employee by:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>their name and social insurance number;</li>
            <li>their rate of pay per hour, week or month;</li>
            <li>the number of regular and overtime hours they worked;</li>
            <li>their rate of pay for overtime;</li>
            <li>their gross earnings;</li>
            <li>any other earnings such as vacation pay, bonuses or commissions;</li>
            <li>the precise amount of deductions for Canada Pension Plan, income tax, Employment Insurance and mandatory deductions;</li>
            <li>any other deductions; and,</li>
            <li>their net pay, which is determined by subtracting all deductions from the gross wage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Every organization should designate someone other than the person responsible for staffing and supervision to prepare the payroll and payments. If this is not the case, one should be especially prudent when reviewing the project’s financial information.</p>
            <p>By reviewing payroll procedures, one can:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>confirm the right individuals are being paid on time and for wages specified in the agreement;</li>
            <li>verify wage costs by referring to payroll records, attendance records, the check register and pay stubs;</li>
            <li>confirm the rate of pay and proper deductions Mandatory Employment-Related Costs (MERCs) for each employee and project participant (if applicable) through a review of payroll records for the claim period;</li>
            <li>check that participants do, in fact, exist (through activity monitoring, if applicable);</li>
            <li>cross-reference payroll with attendance records;</li>
            <li>confirm payment of wages in the cheque register;</li>
            <li>check pay stubs, if necessary; and,</li>
            <li>ensure payments are made and posted in a regular and timely manner.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ask oneself the following questions in order to obtain the information required when completing this aspect of the financial monitor:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Is the payroll processed by the organization or through an external organization such as a bank or an agency?</li>
            <li>Are project staff salaries or benefits claimed to the project according to the approved budget?</li>
            <li>Are attendance records maintained?</li>
            <li>If yes, what kinds of records are maintained?</li>
            <li>If no, how does the organization record absences?</li>
            <li>How many hours are in a normal work week?</li>
            <li>Who certifies the records?</li>
            <li>How frequently is certification performed?</li>
            <li>How many employees were on the payroll at the time of the visit?</li>
            <li>Were any reasons noted for undue absenteeism?</li>
            <li>Are TD-1 forms completed and signed by employees under the agreement?</li>
            <li>Does the organization provide employees with bonus payments, overtime or other forms of compensation?</li>
            <li>How are employees paid (cheque or direct deposit)?</li>
            <li>Are the T-4 slips consistent with employee earnings records?</li>
            <li>Were T-4 slips prepared for the taxation years covered by the project?</li>
            <li>Has vacation pay been paid, taken in time or accumulated for disbursement, for each pay period?</li>
            <li>If vacation pay was not paid on every pay cheque, has it been paid to all terminated employees?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>More detailed financial monitoring may also involve comparing participant data forms with payroll records for social insurance numbers and endorsement signatures.</p>
            <p>When checking payroll records for employees, simply record the employee’s name as it remains the organization's responsibility to ensure that all project employees are legally entitled to work in Canada; <abbr title="Human Resources and Social Development Canada">HRSDC</abbr>, therefore, does not require the social insurance numbers of staff members.</p>
            <h5>Participant Costs</h5>
            <p>Program delivery staff can consult substantiating documents—the journal, general ledger, cheque register, receipts, disbursement records, invoices, vouchers—and take the following steps to verify participant costs:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Confirm that all expenditures have been authorized under the agreement.</li>
            <li>Ascertain whether they are necessary for project activities.  Make sure that receipts with the correct amounts, dates and names of individuals are available to corroborate each expenditure.</li>
            <li>Check that the receipts/voucher/invoice amount corresponds to the information listed in the journal of accounts payable, receipts and disbursement records, and that this is the same information found in the cheque register and on the cancelled cheque.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Verify with project participants that they have indeed received the amounts shown on the claim form.</p>
            <h5>Receiver General Remittances</h5>
            <p>Receiver General remittances are the amounts that employers pay the federal government, on their own behalf and on behalf of their employees, such as Employment Insurance, CPP/QPP deductions, etc. Check these to verify that the:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>employer is following correct accounting practices; and,</li>
            <li>employee will receive the benefits if and when the need arises.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Program delivery staff should confirm that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>all remittances to date have been sent out by the 15th of the following month;</li>
            <li>no penalties incurred by late remittances have been charged to the project because such penalties are the organization’s responsibility;</li>
            <li>the total for EI plus CPP plus tax deducted from employee's pay is in agreement with the payroll totals for the same period;</li>
            <li>the correct total by category for CPP and EI was multiplied by the correct factor for the employer's share;</li>
            <li>the employer's cost is mathematically correct; and,</li>
            <li>the total remitted amount was correct.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keep in mind that it may not always be possible to corroborate the above points when monitoring a large organization. Specifically, when there is a large organization payroll involved and the project payroll is only one component of the larger whole, one may only be able to confirm that remittances were calculated correctly on the payroll, and that the organization is submitting overall organizational remittances. If program delivery staff have any concerns in this area, discuss them with colleagues, the manager or a financial officer.</p>
            <h5>Capital Costs/ Capital Assets</h5>
            <p>Program delivery staff can consult substantiating documents—the journal, general ledger, cheque register, receipts, disbursement records and invoices—and take the following steps to verify capital costs during a financial monitor:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>confirm that all capital expenditures have been authorized under the agreement;</li>
            <li>review invoices to ensure they are properly addressed and dated and include a description of the goods or services;</li>
            <li>establish that the capital assets listed in the invoices are actually on hand. For example, ask to view the items during the visit. Verify the number of pieces of equipment and, if applicable, their serial numbers; and,</li>
            <li>check that the purchase amount and supplier who issued the invoice correspond to the information listed in the journal of accounts payable, receipts and disbursement records, and that this is the same information found in the cheque register and on the cancelled cheque.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Project Costs</h5>
            <p>Program delivery staff can consult substantiating documents—the journal, general ledger, cheque register, receipts, disbursement records, invoices, vouchers—and take the following steps to verify project costs:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>confirm that all expenditures have been authorized under the agreement;</li>
            <li>review invoices to ensure they are properly addressed and dated and include a description of the goods or services; and,</li>
            <li>Check that the purchase amount and supplier information who issued the invoice correspond to the information listed in the journal of accounts payable, receipts and disbursements records, and that this is the same information found on the cheque register and cancelled cheque</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chapter 12. Close-out</h3>
            </summary>
            <p>Close-out occurs when the project has come to an  end and the Department has received and processed the required information. This  process determines and documents whether the recipient has:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>met project objectives;</li>
            <li>completed project activities; and,</li>
            <li>achieved expected results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From a financial administration point-of-view, this  phase involves the close-out, in the Common System for Grants and Contributions  (<abbr>CSGC</abbr>), of an open project after the final claim has been received and accepted  as a fair representation of allowable expenses. Once the Department establishes  the recipient&rsquo;s final entitlement to outstanding funds, any unused portion is  de-committed (returned to the Department&rsquo;s budget) and the project closed.</p>
            <p>Close-out is also a unique phase in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>; please  see the <em>Close-out</em> section of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> User  Guide for further details.<br />
            The funding agreement and project monitoring  reports determine which specific tasks must be undertaken before a project and  the project file can be closed and archived.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff should remind the recipient,  prior to the project end date, of their responsibilities, as described in the  agreement. These may include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
            <li>submitting  the final claim, activity report and supporting documentation (if applicable)  within the allocated timeframe following the project end date;</li>
            <li>submitting  final project reporting (providing evidence of completed activities);</li>
            <li>account  for cash and in-kind contributions from the recipient and/or other sources of  funding (if applicable);</li>
            <li>submitting  any other reports as per the agreement; and</li>
            <li>disposing  of capital assets as per agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Program delivery staff are, in turn, responsible  for:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>reviewing the final claim, activity  report, other reports i.e. final project report, cash and in-kind contributions  from other sources and supporting documentation (if applicable);</li>
            <li>issuing final payment (if  applicable);</li>
            <li>reviewing interest  and / or revenues generated by project activities (if applicable); </li>
            <li>documenting any issues that  require follow-up; and</li>
            <li>informing the recipient of  those issues and their timelines to address them.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>12.1 Final Project Evaluation</h4>
            <p>Before one can officially close out a project in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, several tasks must first be completed in order to confirm that the recipient  and the Department are ready for this stage.</p>
            <p>Evaluation work may begin with a final contact with  the recipient, assess project status and discuss any outstanding issues such as  the disposal of assets and any overpayment amounts they may owe.</p>
            <p>In certain cases, it may be decided that an audit  is warranted in order to verify a project&rsquo;s financial or program compliance.</p>
            <h5>Final Contact</h5>
            <p>Given individual project circumstances and program  capacity and resources, a final on-site visit may not be practical or  warranted.</p>
            <p>In cases where a final on-site visit is feasible  the final visit can help establish what activities remain incomplete and how  quickly the file can be closed.</p>
            <p>Within the framework of a final contact, program  delivery staff should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>review the agreement,  amendments (if applicable), monitoring reports and any notes to file;</li>
            <li>if warranted, do a final  monitor using the <a href="/eng/coegc/docs/monitoring_financial.doc">Financial Monitoring Report Form</a> or program  equivalent form ;</li>
            <li>complete the Close-Out  Summary Report or the program&rsquo;s  equivalent form to document findings, comments and recommendations; in  particular, any anomalies or difficulties the recipient encountered during the  project&rsquo;s life cycle, and how they have addressed them; </li>
            <li>review interest and / or  revenues generated by project activities and,</li>
            <li>follow through on any special situations &ndash;  disposal of capital assets, overpayments, audits -- as listed below.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Disposal of Capital Assets</h5>
            <p>The funding agreement  includes a clause on how to dispose of the capital assets.&nbsp; When applicable, the recipient will submit a  request to dispose the capital assets acquired as a result of the project. Program delivery staff should assess the  request to ensure that the capital assets will be disposed of in a manner  approved by the funding program.&nbsp; Only  the Department can approve the disposal request for capital assets and a copy  of the approval must be retained in the file.</p>
            <h5>Overpayments</h5>
            <p>An overpayment occurs when the  recipient has received payments in excess of what they are eligible for.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>As per the <a href="http://dialogue/grp/DGDPF-CFOB-PolFin-FinPol/Departmental%20Financial%20Policy%20Archives/CFO%20grants%20and%20contribution%20(2004)%20en.docx"><em>Grants and Contributions  Policy</em></a>, once an  overpayment has been identified, program delivery staff must:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>inform the recipient both verbally and in  writing of the amount owing;</li>
            <li>ask the recipient to remit the overpaid amount,  by cheque, to the Receiver General for Canada within 30 days.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If payment is not received within the 30 day time period, program delivery staff must:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Send an  overpayment notice to the recipient and request that an overpayment be created in  the Departmental Accounts Receivable System (DARS). </li>
            <li>To establish  an overpayment in DARS a request must be sent through the <a href="http://iservice.prv/eng/service_catalogues/index.shtml">Accounting  Services Catalogue</a> under Account receivable (<abbr>DARS</abbr>) &ndash; Transaction  Request (Establishment Request).</li>
            <li>Program delivery staff must also record  information about the DARS account in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> using &nbsp;the <a href="/eng/coegc/csgc/plc/user_guide/chapter13.shtml#chapter13_9"><em>Establish Overpayment in DARS</em></a> screen. This will ensure that information is readily available to other  program areas dealing with the same recipient, and;</li>
            <li>Lastly, program delivery staff must add a note  to file indicating that there is an overpayment registered in DARS with the  date and the amount of the overpayment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If payment or  other satisfactory arrangements are not made within a reasonable amount of  time, the Canada Revenue Agency has the responsibility for debt collection once  it has been entered in DARS.</p>
            <p>Any overpayments  discovered after the project is closed should be recorded directly in DARS and  documented in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> as a note to file.</p>
            <p>Please refer to  CFOB&rsquo;s <a href="http://iservice.prv/eng/finance/card/procedures.shtml">Guideline on Manual Payments and Returned Money</a> for the additional information on how to  address an overpayment.</p>
            <p>In some circumstances, an organization&rsquo;s  overpayment may be removed from the Department&rsquo;s accounts receivable records  after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted without success.  This is known as a write-off.&nbsp; Write-offs  are recommended to the Department by Canada Revenue Agency and approved by the <a href="http://iservice.prv/eng/finance/DELEG/deleg-toc.shtml">delegated authority</a>.</p>
            <p>Unlike the remission of an overpayment&mdash;where  the overpayment is cancelled and the Crown gives up the right to resume  collection at a future date&mdash;a write-off does not forgive or cancel the  organization&rsquo;s overpayment, and must meet the criteria of the Treasury Board  Debt Write-off Regulations as being uncollectible. The Crown also reserves the  right to recover the overpayment at a later date.</p>
            <p>For additional information please refer to the <a href="http://iservice.prv/eng/finance/policies/writeoffdebt.shtml">CFOB  policy on debt write-off.</a></p>
            <h5>Audits</h5>
            <p>The new Risk Assessment, Management  and Mitigation (RAMM) approach will introduce a new audit strategy for  departmental <abbr title="Grants and Contributions">Gs&amp;Cs</abbr> programs.<strong> This section will therefore be revised as  new information becomes available.</strong></p>
            <p>Auditing is the  systematic examination and verification of accounting or project activity  records that is undertaken either internally or by a qualified third party  (such as a chartered accountant, certified general accountant or certified  management accountant).</p>
            <p><strong>There are two main types of audits:</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>Financial audit: </strong>covers concepts of reasonable assurance,  completeness, management estimates, internal controls and presentation format  for information assessed against Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  (GAAP). It helps the Department form an opinion as to whether financial  statements and other financial information are presented fairly and agree with  GAAP. </li>
            <li><strong>Recipient  audit: </strong>examines compliance with  agreement provisions, confirming whether specified activities were undertaken,  and claimed expenditures were for eligible costs. </li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Paying for Audits</h5>
            <p>Audits can be paid using:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Operations and Maintenance funds: The Department must pay the cost of  monitoring, audit and evaluation activities related to transfer payment  programs, unless the funding agreement contains a provision that specifies  otherwise. In other words, if the Department contracts an external auditor to  conduct the audit on behalf of the Department, it must do so using a service  contract paid for using O&amp;M funds. The audit report then becomes the  property of the Department.</li>
            <li>Contribution funds: Program delivery staff may invoke an existing audit  provision in the funding agreement if one requires an outside auditor to review  the project&rsquo;s financial records and the cost has been included in the budget as  an eligible expenditure. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>To invoke this provision:</p>
            <p>Determine first if the funds allocated  for auditing expenses are sufficient, or if an amendment to the agreement is  required;</p>
            <ul>
            <li>if an amendment is required, calculate  whether the agreement has reached its maximum level of contribution; and, </li>
            <li>confirm the level of delegated  authority required for approval. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>When contribution funds are used, the audit report  becomes the property of the organization. The Department, however, has the  right to approve the selection of the external auditor and require that the  auditor&rsquo;s opinion be supported by signed, audited financial statements and a  statement of disposition of federal contribution funds, including their  eligibility. The Department can also ask the auditor to forward a copy of the  audit to program delivery staff with written authorization from the  organization.</p>
            <h4>12.2 Steps for Closing a File</h4>
            <p>Once the final project evaluation has been completed, one can start working through the more technical steps involved in closing a file.</p>
            <p>These steps involve:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>releasing the holdback amount;</li>
            <li>making final payment;</li>
            <li>completing the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> close-out;</li>
            <li>writing the close-out summary report;</li>
            <li>closing the project file; and,</li>
            <li>monitoring post-agreement obligations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Releasing the Holdback Amount</h5>
            <p>The retention of a holdback amount encourages recipients  to submit final claim, activity reports and supporting documentation (if  applicable) on time, and helps avoid overpayment situations.</p>
            <p>The holdback can be issued once:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the  recipient has complied with the agreement and completed all project activities  in a satisfactory manner;</li>
            <li>the  project expenses are properly documented and supported; </li>
            <li>the  final claim, activity reports and supporting documentation (if applicable) are  accurate and accepted as fairly representing eligible costs; and,</li>
            <li>any  other reports required as part of the agreement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once all these requirements are met, the documents required by the program  delivery staff to initiate the final payment, de-commit remaining funds and  close out the project in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> can be prepared.</p>
            <h5>Making Final Payments</h5>
            <p>The final payment can be issued once:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the  final claim and supporting documentation (if applicable) has been received and  verified;</li>
            <li>the  data in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> <a href="/eng/coegc/csgc/plc/user_guide/chapter13.shtml#chapter13_7"><em>View Financial Transactions</em></a> screen, confirming that all  financial issues have been resolved, has been reviewed;</li>
            <li>the  total on the claim is mathematically correct and, that the approved signing  authority (identified on the claim or advance and activity report) has signed  and dated it to certify the expenditures;</li>
            <li>it  has been ensured that the recipient has either disposed of all capital assets  (as per the agreement) or negotiated a disposition plan;</li>
            <li>if  applicable, all financial or recipient audits required by the agreement have  been received, and all related reports, indicating that all requirements have  been met, have been accepted;</li>
            <li>all  recipient reports specified in agreement provisions, including the final  activity report, have been received; and,</li>
            <li>it  has been confirmed that there is no outstanding overpayment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the final payment has been issued, any remaining funds should be  decommited. These funds will automatically be placed back into the program  budget.</p>
            <h5>Completing the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> Close-out</h5>
            <p>In the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, you must use the <a href="/eng/coegc/csgc/plc/user_guide/chapter13.shtml#chapter13_18"><em>Complete Close-Out</em></a> screen to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Ensure  there are no outstanding financial transactions in the system (i.e. status of  pending, await settlement, await approval, approved, or cancel pending). If an  outstanding commitment exists at the time of close-out, the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> automatically  sends a transaction to SAP to close the commitment; and,</li>
            <li>The balance of the unaccounted advances/ expenses must be zero. If the  balance is not zero, an overpayment must be established in DARS.&nbsp; Refer to overpayment section. </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Writing the Close-out Summary Report</h5>
            <p>The <a href="/eng/coegc/csgc/plc/user_guide/chapter13.shtml#chapter13_14"><em>Close-Out Summary Report</em></a> is a brief evaluative summary  of how the project performed; it contains information about the recipient,  project status, project deliverables and total funding. This report often  proves valuable to other program delivery staff that have no previous  experience with the recipient and would like to research their project  management capacity before considering them for future funding.</p>
            <p>Program delivery staff must:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>complete  the Close-Out Summary Report within the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>;</li>
            <li>have  it approved; &nbsp;and &nbsp;</li>
            <li>record  approval in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In essence, the close-out summary report is written  to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>demonstrate  how project objectives and priorities were met, activities completed, and  timelines kept;</li>
            <li>summarize  project management;</li>
            <li>outline  project participant impacts and benefits, if applicable;</li>
            <li>compare  expected to actual results;</li>
            <li>summarize  monitoring activities completed during the project, as per the <a href="/eng/coegc/csgc/plc/user_guide/chapter12.shtml#chapter12_4_1_1">Assess Project Risk - Monitoring Plan</a> developed earlier;</li>
            <li>identify  any issues encountered;</li>
            <li>describe  the disposal of capital assets, if applicable;</li>
            <li>note  any overpayments;</li>
            <li>recommend  whether to enter into an agreement with this recipient again; and,</li>
            <li>indicate  actions requiring follow up, such as repayment,&nbsp;  outstanding reports or audit requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Program delivery staff observations and comments  are drawn from information obtained from reports, monitoring, on-site visits,  and correspondence with:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the  recipient;</li>
            <li>other  project staff;</li>
            <li>participants;  and,</li>
            <li>community  and other stakeholders.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The report should present objective facts in a professional manner, as the  report and all other documentation in the project file, are accessible to the  public through the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/index.html"><em>Access to  Information Act</em></a>.</p>
            <h5>Closing the Project File</h5>
            <p>Once  a project has ended and all of the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> close-out functions have been  completed, it is time to close both the hard copy and e-copy (in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>) of the  project file. Before one can do this, one must ensure the file is complete,  well-documented and free of drafts, unnecessary papers and duplicate materials.  It is not expected that every electronic documents and correspondence related  to the project file be printed and saved in the paper file.&nbsp; The information should be saved and stored  according to its submitted format.&nbsp;  Electronic documents should be saved in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> under Supporting  Documentation, while hard copies of the documents should be retained in the  physical project file.&nbsp; One does not have  to mirror the other, however; together, they must have all the elements of a  complete project file.</p>
            <p>Importantly,  program delivery staff must check with the program in order to identify which  of the following elements are required either in the hard copy or electronic  version to complete the project file:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>the  signed application, including negotiated  changes;</li>
            <li>any application attachments, such as annual and audit reports;</li>
            <li>documented evidence of community support; </li>
            <li>documented consultations with the member  of Parliament, union representatives &nbsp;and others;</li>
            <li>the <a href="http://forms-formulaires.prv/lc/content/EForms/en/CallForm.html?Lang=en&amp;PDF=ESDC-EMP5211.pdf"><em>Proposal Assessment, Recommendation and Approval Form</em></a> and detailed notes  of the assessment; </li>
            <li>ensure the Schedule Monitor  Details screens in the <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> are complete;</li>
            <li>the agreement itself with original  signatures, including schedules and the <a href="http://forms-formulaires.prv/lc/apps/EForms/pdf/en/ESDC-EMP5538.pdf">Forecast  of Project Expenditures</a>; </li>
            <li>any amendments to the agreement;</li>
            <li>completed monitoring  reports: <a href="http://forms-formulaires.prv/lc/apps/EForms/pdf/en/ESDC-EMP5220.pdf"><em>On-Site Monitoring  Report</em></a>; </li>
            <li>follow-up items;</li>
            <li>correspondence with organization; </li>
            <li>original claim form or advance and activity reports for all periods; </li>
            <li>any internal correspondence between staff, peers and managers relating to the project;</li>
            <li>any <a href="http://forms-formulaires.prv/lc/apps/EForms/pdf/en/ESDC-EMP5224.pdf">notes to file</a> (in addition to <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> notes to file) summarizing phone conversations and action coming out of those  conversations (time, place, issue, commitments);</li>
            <li>participant tracking data; </li>
            <li>signed <em>File Close-Out Summary Report</em>; </li>
            <li>DARS check; </li>
            <li>documents related to authorized  purchases of capital assets or equipment for persons with disabilities and confirmation of disposal of these items at close-out;  and,</li>
            <li>any additional program-specific  documentation and checklists.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The file can be considered closed once the file content  checklist has been completed.</p>
            <p>The responsibility for retaining official files varies from region to  region. The <a href="http://iservice.prv/eng/is/security/topics/security_of_information.shtml">Departmental Security Officer (DSO)</a> advises departmental staff  with respect to meeting legislative requirements, storage, archiving  and disposal of government materials.  Program delivery staff  should consult with the manager  to confirm the appropriate procedures for the  particular office  or region.</p>
            <h4>12.3 Monitoring Post-agreement Obligations</h4>
            <p>In some cases, the recipient is obligated to supply  additional information&mdash;such as follow-up surveys and evaluation reports&mdash; to the  program, according to timelines that extend beyond the project end date. A file  may, therefore, be in the Close-Out phase in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr> and final payments reconciled  in these situations before the outstanding materials are submitted. This phase  must remain open until all outstanding information has been received and  recorded in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>.</p>
            <p>If the recipient does not meet post-agreement  obligations, program delivery staff must contact the recipient at least twice  by phone or in writing to request the additional information. Within one month  of the second attempt, one should:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>outline  the recipient&rsquo;s post-agreement obligations and document the attempts to contact  them; and,</li>
            <li>inform  them in writing and by phone that their failure to comply with these  post-agreement obligations has been documented in the file and will be taken  into consideration if they apply for departmental program funding in the  future.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the non-compliance has been documented in <abbr title="Common System for Grants and Contributions">CSGC</abbr>, the file can then  be closed.</p>
